These new Russia measures: Impose new Commerce Control List (CCL)-based license requirements for Russia; add two new foreign \"direct product\" rules (FDP rules) specific to Russia and Russian `military end users;' specify a license review policy of denial applicable to all of the license requirements being added in this rule, with certain limited exceptions; significantly restrict the use of EAR license exceptions; expand the existing Russia `military end use' and `military end user' control scope to all items \"subject to the EAR\" other than food and medicine designated EAR99, or ECCN 5A992.c and 5D992.c unless for Russian \"government end users\" and Russian state-owned enterprises (SoEs); transfer forty-five Russian entities from the Military End-User (MEU) List to the Entity List with an expanded license requirement of all items subject to the EAR (including foreign-produced items subject to the Russia-MEU FDP rules); and add two new Russia entities and revise two Russia entities to the Entity List. Lastly, this rule imposes comprehensive export, reexport and transfer (in-country) restrictions for the so-called Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) and Luhansk People's Republics (LNR) regions of Ukraine (\"Covered Regions of Ukraine\") and makes conforming revisions to export, reexport transfer (in-country) restrictions for Crimea Region of Ukraine provisions.\n\nOn October 7, 2022, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) released the interim final rule (IFR), \"Implementation of Additional Export Controls: Certain Advanced Computing and Semiconductor Manufacturing Items; Supercomputer and Semiconductor End Use; Entity List Modification\" (October 7 IFR), which amended the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to implement controls on advanced computing integrated circuits (ICs), computer commodities that contain such ICs, and certain semiconductor manufacturing items, and to make other EAR changes to implement appropriate related controls, including on certain \"U.S. person\" activities. This Advanced Computing/ Supercomputing IFR (AC/S IFR) addresses comments received in response to only the part of the October 7 IFR that controls advanced computing ICs and computer commodities that contain such ICs. This rule also makes other changes to make the controls more effective and less burdensome, including by correcting and clarifying the controls to more effectively achieve the policy objectives identified in the October 7 IFR. This AC/S IFR is published concurrently with a second BIS IFR, \"Export Controls on Semiconductor Manufacturing Items,\" which addresses public comments received in response to other portions of the October 7 IFR. Together, these IFRs revise the October 7 IFR controls to more effectively achieve BIS's focused national security policy objectives. These revisions protect U.S. national security interests by further restricting China's ability to obtain critical technologies to modernize its military capabilities in ways that threaten the national security interests of the United States and its allies.\n\nIn this rulemaking, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) proposes revising License Exception Strategic Trade Authorization (STA) under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). The purpose of these changes is to encourage additional use of License Exception STA for ally and partner countries. BIS proposes specific revisions to License Exception STA and includes questions for public comment to help BIS better understand impediments in using License Exception STA. This proposed rule is part of a broader effort announced today that will revise several categories of export licensing requirements and the availability of export license exceptions for key allied and partner countries, as well as for members of certain multilateral export control regimes."}

This rule also expands the eligibility for the use of license exceptions under the EAR for MT-controlled items. These changes to license exception eligibility are also being made as part of a broader effort announced today that will liberalize several categories of export licensing requirements and the availability of export license exceptions for key allied and partner countries, as well as for members of certain multilateral export control regimes.\n\nThis final rule makes conforming and clarifying changes to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). These changes include making conforming changes to the EAR to ensure that destination names reflect the current destination names that are recognized by the United States Government, clarifying the removal of certain license requirements for exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) to and within Australia and the United Kingdom, making a conforming change to reflect that Cyprus is no longer a Country Group D:5 country, and clarifying how Russia and the Russian Federation are referenced for consistency with the designation of Russia as a U.S. Arms Embargoed destinations.\n\nIn this final rule, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) makes changes to the Syria export control measures under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), consistent with Executive Order (E.O.) 14312, Providing for the Revocation of Syria Sanctions, which directed the removal of sanctions on Syria. This final rule relaxes the EAR's existing restrictions on exports and reexports to Syria of items subject to the EAR by making the following changes: revising certain restrictive license application review policies that had applied to most items subject to the EAR to be more favorable; expanding existing license exceptions to apply to Syria; and adding new license exceptions for Syria, including for EAR99 items."}

These controls are the product of extensive discussions with international partners.\n\nOn September 6, 2024, BIS published in the Federal Register an interim final rule entitled \"Commerce Control List Additions and Revisions; Implementation of Controls on Advanced Technologies Consistent with Controls Implemented by International Partners\" (RIN 0694-AJ60) that contained inadvertent errors. This rule corrects those errors.\n\nWith this interim final rule (IFR), the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) is revising the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to address the accelerating development and deployment of advanced biotechnology tools contrary to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. This rule institutes new controls on certain biotechnology equipment and related technology. It further solicits public comments on the changes it implements."}

The October 7 IFR also made other EAR changes to ensure appropriate related controls, including on certain \"U.S. person\" activities. This IFR addresses comments received in response to only the part of the October 7 IFR that controls semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME) and amends the EAR to implement SME controls more effectively and to address ongoing national security concerns.\n\nThe Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), seeks public comment on proposed changes to existing restrictions under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) on military and intelligence end uses and end users and related U.S. persons activities controls, as well as the proposed addition of a military-support end-user control. These proposed revisions and additions to the EAR's end-use, end-user, and \"U.S. persons\" activity controls would implement expanded Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (ECRA) authority to control certain \"U.S. persons\" activities under the EAR. Specific to the EAR's \"U.S. persons\" activities controls, BIS is proposing amendments to control `support' furnished by \"U.S. persons\" to military end users and military-production activities, as well as intelligence end users that are not otherwise already regulated under or prohibited by U.S. law. In addition, BIS is proposing to revise the definition of `support' set forth in the EAR's \"U.S. person\" activity control provision in response to requests by the public for clarification. The revisions and additions, along with clarifications, to end use, end user, and \"U.S. persons\" activity controls under the EAR, would further the national security and the foreign policy of the United States.\n\nThe Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), seeks public comments on proposed amendments to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) in support of U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.

The proposed additions of the foreign-security end user control and \"U.S. persons\" activity controls would implement expanded authority under the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (ECRA), as amended, to control certain \"U.S. persons\" activities under the EAR. Specific to the EAR's \"U.S. persons\" activities controls, BIS is proposing amendments to control \"support\" furnished by \"U.S. persons\" to identified foreign-security end users. In addition, BIS is proposing to add to the Commerce Control List two new unilateral item controls on facial recognition technology."}
