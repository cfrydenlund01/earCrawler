A person may undertake transactions subject to the EAR without a license or other authorization, unless the regulations affirmatively state such a requirement. As such, if an export, reexport, or activity is subject to the EAR, the general prohibitions contained in this part and the License Exceptions specified in part 740 of the EAR must be reviewed to determine if a license is necessary. In the case of all exports from the United States, you must document your export as described in part 762 of the EAR regarding recordkeeping and clear your export through the U.S. Customs Service as described in part 758 of the EAR regarding export clearance requirements. Also note that for short supply controls all prohibitions and License Exceptions are in part 754 of the EAR.\n\n( a ) In this part we tell you:\n\n( 1 ) The facts that make your proposed export, reexport, or conduct subject to these general prohibitions, and\n\n( 2 ) The ten general prohibitions.\n\n( b ) Your obligations under the ten general prohibitions and under the EAR depend in large part upon the five types of information described in § 736.2(a) of this part and upon the general prohibitions described in § 736.2(b) of this part . The ten general prohibitions contain cross-references to other parts of the EAR that further define the breadth of the general prohibitions. For that reason, this part is not freestanding. In part 732, we provide certain steps you may follow in proper order to help you understand the general prohibitions and their relationship to other parts of the EAR.\n\n( c ) If you violate any of these ten general prohibitions, or engage in other conduct contrary to the Export Administration Act, the EAR, or any order, license, License Exception, or authorization issued thereunder, as described in part 764 of the EAR regarding enforcement, you will be subject to the sanctions described in that part.",

      "text": "15 CFR 736.2\n§ 736.2 General prohibitions and determination of applicability.\n\n( a ) Information or facts that determine the applicability of the general prohibitions. The following five types of facts determine your obligations under the ten general prohibitions and the EAR generally (also see other parts of the EAR where the license requirements and other EAR restrictions are specified in greater detail):\n\n( 1 ) Classification of the item. The classification of the item on the Commerce Control List (see part 774 of the EAR) or description of the item in supplements no. 2, 4, or 6 to part 746 of the EAR. For guidance on classifying items, see the Commerce Control List Order of Review in supplement no. 4 to part 774 and for determining licensing requirements using the Commerce Control List in supplement no. 1 to part 774 and the Commerce Country Chart in supplement no. 1 to part 738, see § 738.4 ;\n\nThe description of items in supplements no. 2, 4, or 6 of part 746 are used for determining license requirements for Russia and Belarus under §§ 746.5 and 746.10 . Items described in supplements no. 2, 4, or 6 in most cases are designated as EAR99 (subject to the EAR but not specifically listed on the Commerce Control List).\n\n( 2 ) Destination. The country of ultimate destination for an export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) (see parts 738 and 774 of the EAR concerning the Country Chart and the Commerce Control List for export and reexport license requirements and part 746 for additional license requirements based on embargoes and other special controls for exports, reexports, or certain transfers (in-country));\n\n( 3 ) End user or end use. The ultimate end user (see General Prohibition Four ( paragraph (b)(4) of this section) and supplement no. 1 to part 764 of the EAR for references to persons with whom your transaction may not be permitted; see General Prohibition Five ( Paragraph (b)(5) of this section) and part 744 for references to end users for whom you may need an export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) license). Certain EAR requirements ( e.g., §§ 734.9(e) , 744.11(a) ), and 744.15(b)) extend to all parties to the transaction as described in § 748.5(c) through (f) . Many of the end-use controls in part 744 specify destinations or Country Groups as part of the criteria for defining the scope of the end use controls.\n\n( 4 ) End-use. The ultimate end-use (see General Prohibition Five ( paragraph (b)(5) of this section) and part 744 of the EAR for general end-use restrictions); and\n\n( 5 ) Conduct. Conduct such as contracting, financing, and freight forwarding in support of a proliferation project or a 'military-intelligence end use' or a 'military-intelligence end user,' as described in part 744 of the EAR.\n\n( b ) General prohibitions. The following ten general prohibitions describe certain exports, reexports, transfers (in-country), and other conduct, subject to the scope of the EAR, in which you may not engage unless you either have a license from the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) or qualify under part 740 of the EAR for a License Exception from each applicable general prohibition in this paragraph. The License Exceptions at part 740 of the EAR apply only to General Prohibitions One (Exports and Reexports in the Form Received), Two (Parts and Components Reexports), and Three (Foreign-Produced “Direct Product” Reexports); however, selected License Exceptions are specifically referenced and authorized in part 746 of the EAR concerning embargo destinations and in § 744.2(c) of the EAR regarding nuclear end-uses and in § 744.11 and in supplement no. 4 to part 744—Entity List.\n\n( 1 ) General Prohibition One—Export and reexport of controlled items to listed countries (Exports and Reexports). You may not, without a license or License Exception, export any item subject to the EAR to another country or reexport any item of U.S.-origin if each of the following is true:\n\n( i ) The item is controlled for a reason indicated in the applicable Export Control Classification Number (ECCN), and\n\n( ii ) Export to the country of destination requires a license for the control reason as indicated on the Country Chart at part 738 of the EAR. (The scope of this prohibition is determined by the correct classification of your item and the ultimate destination as that combination is reflected on the Country Chart.) [ 1 ] Note that each License Exception described at part 740 of the EAR supersedes General Prohibition One if all terms and conditions of a given License Exception are met by the exporter or reexporter.\n\n( 2 ) General Prohibition Two—Reexport and export from abroad of foreign-made items incorporating more than a de minimis amount of controlled U.S. content (U.S. Content Reexports).\n\n( i ) You may not, without a license or license exception, reexport or export from abroad foreign-made commodities that incorporate controlled U.S.-origin commodities, foreign-made commodities that are “bundled” with controlled U.S.-origin software, foreign-made software that is commingled with controlled U.S.-origin software, or foreign-made technology that is commingled with controlled U.S.-origin technology if such items require a license according to any of the provisions in the EAR and incorporate or are commingled with more than a de minimis amount of controlled U.S. content, as defined in § 734.4 of the EAR concerning the scope of the EAR.\n\n( A ) It incorporates more than the de minimis amount of controlled U.S. content, as defined in § 734.4 of the EAR concerning the scope of the EAR;\n\n( B ) It is controlled for a reason indicated in the applicable ECCN; and\n\n( C ) Its export to the country of destination requires a license for that control reason as indicated on the Country Chart. (The scope of this prohibition is determined by the correct classification of your foreign-made item and the ultimate destination, as that combination is reflected on the Country Chart.)",

The following ten general prohibitions describe certain exports, reexports, transfers (in-country), and other conduct, subject to the scope of the EAR, in which you may not engage unless you either have a license from the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) or qualify under part 740 of the EAR for a License Exception from each applicable general prohibition in this paragraph. The License Exceptions at part 740 of the EAR apply only to General Prohibitions One (Exports and Reexports in the Form Received), Two (Parts and Components Reexports), and Three (Foreign-Produced “Direct Product” Reexports); however, selected License Exceptions are specifically referenced and authorized in part 746 of the EAR concerning embargo destinations and in § 744.2(c) of the EAR regarding nuclear end-uses and in § 744.11 and in supplement no. 4 to part 744—Entity List.\n\n( 1 ) General Prohibition One—Export and reexport of controlled items to listed countries (Exports and Reexports). You may not, without a license or License Exception, export any item subject to the EAR to another country or reexport any item of U.S.-origin if each of the following is true:\n\n( i ) The item is controlled for a reason indicated in the applicable Export Control Classification Number (ECCN), and\n\n( ii ) Export to the country of destination requires a license for the control reason as indicated on the Country Chart at part 738 of the EAR. (The scope of this prohibition is determined by the correct classification of your item and the ultimate destination as that combination is reflected on the Country Chart.) [ 1 ] Note that each License Exception described at part 740 of the EAR supersedes General Prohibition One if all terms and conditions of a given License Exception are met by the exporter or reexporter.\n\n( 2 ) General Prohibition Two—Reexport and export from abroad of foreign-made items incorporating more than a de minimis amount of controlled U.S. content (U.S. Content Reexports).\n\n( i ) You may not, without a license or license exception, reexport or export from abroad foreign-made commodities that incorporate controlled U.S.-origin commodities, foreign-made commodities that are “bundled” with controlled U.S.-origin software, foreign-made software that is commingled with controlled U.S.-origin software, or foreign-made technology that is commingled with controlled U.S.-origin technology if such items require a license according to any of the provisions in the EAR and incorporate or are commingled with more than a de minimis amount of controlled U.S. content, as defined in § 734.4 of the EAR concerning the scope of the EAR.\n\n( A ) It incorporates more than the de minimis amount of controlled U.S. content, as defined in § 734.4 of the EAR concerning the scope of the EAR;\n\n( B ) It is controlled for a reason indicated in the applicable ECCN; and\n\n( C ) Its export to the country of destination requires a license for that control reason as indicated on the Country Chart. (The scope of this prohibition is determined by the correct classification of your foreign-made item and the ultimate destination, as that combination is reflected on the Country Chart.)\n\n( ii ) Each License Exception described in part 740 of the EAR supersedes General Prohibition Two if all terms and conditions of a given License Exception are met by the exporter or reexporter.\n\n( 3 ) General Prohibition Three—Foreign-direct product (FDP) rules .\n\n( i ) You may not, without a license or license exception, export from abroad, reexport, or transfer (in-country) foreign-“direct products” or other foreign-produced items subject to the EAR pursuant to § 734.9 if such items are subject to a license requirement in part 736, 742, 744, 746, or 764 of the EAR.\n\n( ii ) Each license exception described in part 740 of the EAR supersedes General Prohibition Three if all terms and conditions of a given license exception are met and none of the restrictions of § 740.2 or § 744.11(a) apply.\n\n( 4 ) General Prohibition Four (Denial Orders)—Engaging in actions prohibited by a denial order.\n\n( i ) You may not take any action that is prohibited by a denial order issued under part 766 of the EAR, Administrative Enforcement Proceedings. These orders prohibit many actions in addition to direct exports by the person denied export privileges, including some transfers within a single country, either in the United States or abroad, by other persons. You are responsible for ensuring that any of your transactions in which a person who is denied export privileges is involved do not violate the terms of the order. Orders denying export privileges are published in the Federal Register when they are issued and are the legally controlling documents in accordance with their terms. BIS also maintains compilations of persons denied export privileges on its Web site at http://www.bis.doc.gov .

For kits consisting of replacement parts or components, consult § 740.9(a)(4) of this part .\n\n( ii ) Parts, components, accessories, and attachments may be exported only to replace, on a one-for-one basis, parts, components, accessories, or attachments, respectively, contained in commodities that were: Lawfully exported from the United States; lawfully reexported; or made in a foreign country incorporating authorized parts, components, accessories, or attachments “subject to the EAR” (see § 734.2(a) of the EAR). “600 series” parts, components, accessories and attachments may be exported only to replace, on a one-for-one basis, parts, components, accessories, or attachments that were: lawfully exported from the United States, or lawfully reexported. The conditions of the original U.S. authorization must not have been violated. Accordingly, the export of replacement parts, components, accessories, and attachments may be made only by the party who originally exported or reexported the commodity to be repaired, or by a party that has confirmed the existence of appropriate authority for the original transaction.\n\n( iii ) The parts, components, accessories, or attachments to be replaced must either be destroyed abroad or returned promptly to the person who supplied the replacements, or to a foreign firm that is under the effective control of that person.\n\n( 3 ) Exclusions to License Exception RPL.\n\n( i ) No replacement parts, components, accessories, or attachments may be exported to repair a commodity exported under a license or other authorization if that license or other authorization included a condition that any subsequent replacements may be exported only under a license.\n\n( ii ) No parts, components, accessories, or attachments may be exported to be held abroad as spares for future use. Replacements may be exported to replace spares that were authorized to accompany the export of equipment or other end items as those spares are used in the repair of the equipment or other end item. This allows maintenance of the stock of spares at a consistent level as the parts, components, accessories, or attachments are used.\n\n( iii ) No parts, components, accessories, or attachments may be exported to any destination, except the countries listed in supplement no. 3 to part 744 of the EAR (Countries Not Subject to Certain Nuclear End Use Restrictions in § 744.2(a) ), if the item is to be incorporated into or used in nuclear weapons, nuclear explosive devices, nuclear testing related to activities described in § 744.2(a) of the EAR, the chemical processing of irradiated special nuclear or source material, the production of heavy water, the separation of isotopes of source and special nuclear materials, or the fabrication of nuclear reactor fuel containing plutonium, as described in § 744.2(a) of the EAR.\n\n( iv ) No replacement parts, components, accessories, or attachments may be exported to countries in Country Group E:1 (see supplement no. 1 to this part) (countries designated by the Secretary of State as supporting acts of international terrorism) if the commodity to be repaired is an “aircraft” (as defined in § 772.1 of the EAR) or is controlled for national security (NS) reasons.\n\n( v ) No replacement parts, components, accessories, or attachments may be exported to countries in Country Group E:1 (see supplement no. 1 to this part) if the commodity to be repaired is explosives detection equipment classified under ECCN 2A983 or related software classified under ECCN 2D983.\n\n( vi ) No replacement parts, components, accessories, or attachments may be exported to countries in Country Group E:1 (see supplement no. 1 to this part) if the commodity to be repaired is concealed object detection equipment classified under ECCN 2A984 or related software classified under ECCN 2D984.",

(These terms include ‘subassemblies,’ but do not include test instruments or operating supplies. The term ‘ subassembly’ means a number of parts or components assembled to perform a specific function or functions within a commodity. One example would be printed circuit boards with components mounted thereon. This definition does not include major subsystems such as those composed of a number of ‘subassemblies.’) Items that improve or change the basic design characteristics, e.g., as to accuracy, capability, performance or productivity, of the equipment or other end item upon which they are installed, are not deemed to be replacement parts, components, accessories, or attachments.

This paragraph (a) authorizes exports and reexports of commodities or software to the IAEA and Euratom, and reexports by IAEA and Euratom for official international safeguard use, as follows:\n\n( i ) Commodities or software consigned to the IAEA at its headquarters in Vienna, Austria or its field offices in Toronto, Ontario, Canada or in Tokyo, Japan for official international safeguards use.\n\n( ii ) Commodities or software consigned to the Euratom Safeguards Directorate in Luxembourg, Luxembourg for official international safeguards use.\n\n( iii ) Commodities or software consigned to IAEA or Euratom may be reexported to any country for IAEA or Euratom international safeguards use provided that IAEA or Euratom maintains control of or otherwise safeguards the commodities or software and returns the commodities or software to the locations described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of this section when they become obsolete, are no longer required, or are replaced.\n\n( iv ) Commodity or software shipments may be made by persons under direct contract with IAEA or Euratom, or by Department of Energy National Laboratories as directed by the Department of State or the Department of Energy.\n\n( v ) The monitoring functions of IAEA and Euratom are not subject to the restrictions on prohibited safeguarded nuclear activities described in § 744.2(a)(3) of the EAR.\n\n( vi ) When commodities or software originally consigned to IAEA or Euratom are no longer in IAEA or Euratom official safeguards use, such commodities may be disposed of by destruction or by reexport or transfer in accordance with the EAR.\n\n( 2 ) Restrictions.\n\n( i ) Items on the Sensitive List (see supplement no. 6 to part 774 of the EAR) may not be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) under this paragraph (a) , except to the countries listed in Country Group A:5 (See supplement no.1 to part 740 of the EAR).\n\n( ii ) Items on the Very Sensitive List (see supplement no. 7 to part 774 of the EAR) may not be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) under this paragraph (a) .\n\n( iii ) Encryption items controlled for EI reasons under ECCNs 5A002, 5A004, 5D002, or 5E002 may not be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) under this paragraph (a) . See § 740.17 of the EAR (License Exception ENC) for possible alternative license exception authorization.\n\n( iv ) Without prior authorization from the Bureau of Industry and Security, nationals of countries in Country Group E:1(see supplement no. 1 to this part) may not physically or computationally access computers that have been enhanced by “electronic assemblies,” which have been exported or reexported under License Exception GOV and have been used to enhance such computers by aggregation of processors so that the APP of the aggregation exceeds the APP parameter set forth in ECCN 4A003.b.\n\n( v ) “600 series” items may not be exported or reexported under this paragraph (a) , except to the countries listed in Country Group A:5 (see supplement no.1 to this part).\n\n( b ) United States Government —\n\n( 1 ) Scope. The provisions of this paragraph (b) authorize exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) to personnel and agencies of the U.S. Government and certain exports by, for or at the direction of the Department of Defense or the Department of Energy. “Agency of the U.S. Government” includes all civilian and military departments, branches, missions, government-owned corporations, and other agencies of the U.S. Government but does not include such national agencies as the American Red Cross or international organizations in which the United States participates such as the Organization of American States. Therefore, shipments may not be made to these non-governmental national or international agencies, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section for U.S. representatives to these organizations. For purposes of paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) , (b)(2)(iii)(B) and (C) of this section, BIS has determined that a Space Act Agreement (SAA) to which the National Aeronautics Space Agency (NASA) is a party meets the criteria of these paragraphs for being authorized by law and subject to control by the President by other means.\n\n( 2 ) Eligibility —",

The provisions of this paragraph (b) authorize exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) to personnel and agencies of the U.S. Government and certain exports by, for or at the direction of the Department of Defense or the Department of Energy. “Agency of the U.S. Government” includes all civilian and military departments, branches, missions, government-owned corporations, and other agencies of the U.S. Government but does not include such national agencies as the American Red Cross or international organizations in which the United States participates such as the Organization of American States. Therefore, shipments may not be made to these non-governmental national or international agencies, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section for U.S. representatives to these organizations. For purposes of paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) , (b)(2)(iii)(B) and (C) of this section, BIS has determined that a Space Act Agreement (SAA) to which the National Aeronautics Space Agency (NASA) is a party meets the criteria of these paragraphs for being authorized by law and subject to control by the President by other means.\n\n( 2 ) Eligibility —\n\n( i ) Items for personal use by personnel and agencies of the U.S. Government. This provision is available for items in quantities sufficient only for the personal use of members of the U.S. Armed Forces or civilian personnel of the U.S. Government (including U.S. representatives to public international organizations), and their immediate families and household employees. Items for personal use include household effects, food, beverages, and other daily necessities.\n\n( ii ) Exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) made by or consigned to a department or agency of the U.S. Government. This paragraph authorizes exports, reexports, and transfers of items when made by or consigned to a department or agency of the U.S. Government solely for its official use or for carrying out any U.S. Government program with foreign governments or international organizations that is authorized by law and subject to control by the President by other means. This paragraph does not authorize a department or agency of the U.S. Government to make any export, reexport, or transfer that is otherwise prohibited by other administrative provisions or by statute. Contractor support personnel of a department or agency of the U.S. Government are eligible for this authorization when in the performance of their duties pursuant to the applicable contract or other official duties. 'Contractor support personnel' for the purpose of this provision means those persons who provide administrative, managerial, scientific or technical support under contract to a U.S. Government department or agency ( e.g., contractor employees of Federally Funded Research Facilities or Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance contractors). The term 'contractor support personnel' for purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii) is limited to those individuals who are providing such support within a U.S. Government owned or operated facility or under the direct supervision of a U.S. government employee ( i.e., an individual directly employed by the U.S. Government). Private security contractors are not 'contractor support personnel' for purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii) because although they may work within a U.S. Government owned or operated facility, such contractors do not provide administrative, managerial, scientific or technical support under contract to the U.S. Government. This authorization is not available when a department or agency of the U.S. Government acts as a transmittal agent on behalf of a non-U.S. Government person, either as a convenience or in satisfaction of security requirements.\n\n( iii ) Exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) made for or on behalf of a department or agency of the U.S. Government.\n\n( A ) This paragraph authorizes exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of items solely for use by a department or agency of the U.S. Government, when:\n\n( 1 ) The items are destined to a U.S. person; and\n\n( 2 ) The item is exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) pursuant to a contract between the exporter and a department or agency of the U.S. Government;\n\n( B ) This paragraph authorizes exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of items to implement or support any U.S. Government cooperative program, project, agreement, or arrangement with a foreign government or international organization or agency that is authorized by law and subject to control by the President by other means, when:\n\n( 1 ) The agreement is in force and in effect, or the arrangement is in operation;\n\n( 2 ) The exporter, reexporter, or transferor obtains a written authorization from the Secretary or agency head of the U.S. Government department or agency responsible for the program, agreement, or arrangement, or his or her designee, authorizing the exporter, reexporter, or transferor to use this license exception. The written authorization must include the scope of items to be shipped under this license exception; the end users and consignees of the items; and any restrictions on the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) (including any restrictions on the foreign release of technology);\n\n( 3 ) The exporter, reexporter, or transferor has a contract with a department or agency of the U.S. Government for the provision of the items in furtherance of the agreement, or arrangement; and\n\n( 4 ) The items being exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) are not controlled for Chemical Weapons Convention (CW) or proliferation of chemical and biological weapons (CB) reasons;\n\n( C ) This paragraph authorizes the 'temporary' export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of an item in support of any foreign assistance or sales program authorized by law and subject to the control of the President by other means, when:",

The provisions of this paragraph (b) authorize exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) to personnel and agencies of the U.S. Government and certain exports by, for or at the direction of the Department of Defense or the Department of Energy. “Agency of the U.S. Government” includes all civilian and military departments, branches, missions, government-owned corporations, and other agencies of the U.S. Government but does not include such national agencies as the American Red Cross or international organizations in which the United States participates such as the Organization of American States. Therefore, shipments may not be made to these non-governmental national or international agencies, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section for U.S. representatives to these organizations. For purposes of paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) , (b)(2)(iii)(B) and (C) of this section, BIS has determined that a Space Act Agreement (SAA) to which the National Aeronautics Space Agency (NASA) is a party meets the criteria of these paragraphs for being authorized by law and subject to control by the President by other means.",

This paragraph authorizes exports, reexports, and transfers of items when made by or consigned to a department or agency of the U.S. Government solely for its official use or for carrying out any U.S. Government program with foreign governments or international organizations that is authorized by law and subject to control by the President by other means.

If there are unexpected delays in a launch schedule for reasons such as mechanical failures in a launch vehicle or weather, commodities exported or reexported under this paragraph (e) may be retained at or near the launch site for a period of six (6) months from the time of initial export or reexport before the commodities must be destroyed, returned to the exporter or reexporter, or be the subject of an individually validated license request submitted to BIS to authorize further disposition of the commodities.\n\n( ii ) Authorization to retain commodity abroad at launch country beyond six months. If, after the commodity is exported or reexported under this authorization, a delay occurs in the launch schedule that would exceed the 6-month deadline in paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section, the exporter or reexporter or the person in control of the commodities in the launch country may request a one-time 6-month extension by submitting written notification to BIS requesting a 6-month extension and noting the reason for the delay. If the requestor is not contacted by BIS within 30 days from the date of the postmark of the written notification and if the notification meets the requirements of this subparagraph, the request is deemed granted. The request must be sent to BIS at the address listed in part 748 of the EAR and should include the name and address of the exporter or reexporter, the name and address of the person who has control of the commodity, the date the commodities were exported or reexported, a brief product description, and the justification for the extension. To retain a commodity abroad beyond the 6-month extension period, the exporter, reexporter or person in control of the commodity must request authorization by submitting a license application in accordance with §§ 748.1, 748.4 and 748.6 of the EAR to BIS 90 days prior to the expiration of the 6-month extension period.\n\n( iii ) Items not delivered to the ISS because of a failed launch. If the commodities exported or reexported under this paragraph (e) of this section are not delivered to the ISS because a failed launch causes the destruction of the commodity prior to its being delivered, exporters and reexporters must make note of the destruction of the commodities in accordance with the recordkeeping requirements under paragraph (e)(8)(ii) of this section and part 762 of the EAR.",

If the commodities are not delivered to the ISS because of a failed launch whereby the item is destroyed prior to being delivered to the ISS, this must be noted for recordkeeping purposes.\n\n( iii ) The return or destruction of defective or worn out parts or components is not required. However, if defective or worn out parts or components originally exported or reexported pursuant to this paragraph (e) are returned from the ISS, then those parts and components may be either: returned to the original country of export or reexport; destroyed; or reexported or transferred (in-country) to a destination that has been designated by NASA for conducting a review and analysis of the defective or worn part or component. Documentation for this activity must be kept for recordkeeping purposes. No commodities that are subject to the EAR may be returned, under the provisions of this paragraph, to a country listed in Country Group E:1 (see supplement no. 1 to this part) or to any person if that person is subject to an end-user or end-use control described in part 744 of the EAR.

The provisions of paragraph (a) authorize exports and reexports of gift parcels by an individual (donor) addressed to an individual, or a religious, charitable or educational organization (donee) located in any destination for the use of the donee or the donee's immediate family (and not for resale). The gift parcel must be provided free of charge to the donee. However, payment by the donee of any handling charges or of any fees levied by the importing country (e.g., import duties, taxes, etc.) is not considered to be a cost to the donee for purposes of this definition of “gift parcel.” [ 1 ]\n\n( 2 ) Commodity, value and other limitations —\n\n( i ) Item limitations —\n\n( A ) Prohibited items.\n\n( 1 ) For Cuba no items listed on the Commerce Control List other than items listed in § 740.19(b) of the EAR may be included in a gift parcel.\n\n( 2 ) For all destinations, no items controlled for chemical and biological weapons (CB), missile technology (MT), national security (NS), nuclear proliferation (NP) or encryption items (EI) reasons on the Commerce Control List (supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) may be included in a gift parcel.\n\n( 3 ) Items prohibited for destinations in Country Group D:1 or E:2. For destinations in Country Group D:1 or E:2, military wearing apparel may not be included in a gift parcel regardless of whether all distinctive U.S. military insignia, buttons, and other markings are removed.\n\n( 4 ) Gold bullion, gold taels, and gold bars are prohibited as are items intended for resale or reexport.\n\n( B ) Eligible items. For all destinations, eligible items are food (including vitamins); medicines, medical supplies and devices (including hospital supplies and equipment and equipment for the handicapped); receive-only radio equipment for reception of commercial/civil AM/FM and short wave publicly available frequency bands, and batteries for such equipment; clothing; personal hygiene items; seeds; veterinary medicines and supplies; fishing equipment and supplies; soap-making equipment; as well as all other items of a type normally sent as gifts between individuals (including items listed in § 740.19(b) of the EAR) except for those items prohibited in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) of this section. Items in gift parcels must be in quantities normally given as gifts between individuals.\n\nExample to paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) of this section. A watch or piece of jewelry is normally sent as a gift. However, multiple watches, either in one package or in subsequent shipments, would not qualify for such gift parcels because the quantity would exceed that normally given between individuals. Similarly, a sewing machine or bicycle within the value limit of this License Exception may be an appropriate gift. However, subsequent shipments of the same item to the same donee would not be a gift normally given between individuals.\n\n( ii ) Import requirements. The commodities must be acceptable in type and quantity by the recipient country for import as gifts. Commodities exceeding the import limits may not be included in gift parcels.\n\n( iii ) Frequency.\n\n( A ) Except for gift parcels of food to Cuba, not more than one gift parcel may be sent from the same donor to the same donee in any one calendar month.\n\n( B ) There is no frequency limit on gift parcels of food to Cuba.\n\n( C ) Parties seeking authorization to exceed the frequency limit due to compelling humanitarian concerns (e.g., for certain gifts of medicine) should submit a license application in accordance with §§ 748.1, 748.4 and 748.6 of the EAR to BIS with complete justification.\n\n( iv ) Value. The combined total domestic retail value of all commodities and software in a single gift parcel may not exceed $800. This limit does not apply to food sent in a gift parcel to Cuba.\n\n( v ) Ineligible recipients.\n\n( A ) No gift parcel may be sent to any of the following officials of the Cuban government: Ministers and Vice-Ministers; members of the Council of State; members of the Council of Ministers; members and employees of the National Assembly of People's Power; members of any provincial assembly; local sector chiefs of the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution; Director Generals and sub-Director Generals and higher of all Cuban ministries and state agencies; employees of the Ministry of the Interior (MININT); employees of the Ministry of Defense (MINFAR); secretaries and first secretaries of the Confederation of Labor of Cuba (CTC) and its component unions; chief editors, editors and deputy editors of Cuban state-run media organizations and programs, including newspapers, television, and radio; or members and employees of the Supreme Court (Tribuno Supremo Nacional).\n\n( B ) No gift parcel may be sent to any member of the Politburo.\n\n( C ) No gift parcel may be sent to organizations administered or controlled by the Cuban Government or the Cuban Communist Party.\n\n( 3 ) How to export gift parcels.\n\n( i ) A gift parcel must be sent directly to the donee by the individual donor, or for such donor by a commercial or other gift-forwarding service or organization. Each gift parcel must show, on the outside wrapper, the name and address of the donor, as well as the name and address of the donee, regardless of whether sent by the donor or by a forwarding service.\n\n( ii ) Each parcel must have the notation “GIFT—Export License Not Required” written on the addressee side of the package and the symbol “GFT” written on any required customs declaration.\n\n( b ) Humanitarian donations —\n\n( 1 ) Scope. The provisions of paragraph (b) authorize exports or reexports by groups or organizations of donations to meet basic human needs when those groups or organizations have experience in maintaining a verifiable system of distribution that ensures delivery to the intended beneficiaries.",

      "text": "15 CFR 740.12(a)\n§ 740.12 Gift parcels and humanitarian donations (GFT).\n\n( a ) Gift parcels —\n\n( 1 ) Scope. The provisions of paragraph (a) authorize exports and reexports of gift parcels by an individual (donor) addressed to an individual, or a religious, charitable or educational organization (donee) located in any destination for the use of the donee or the donee's immediate family (and not for resale). The gift parcel must be provided free of charge to the donee. However, payment by the donee of any handling charges or of any fees levied by the importing country (e.g., import duties, taxes, etc.) is not considered to be a cost to the donee for purposes of this definition of “gift parcel.” [ 1 ]\n\n( 2 ) Commodity, value and other limitations —\n\n( i ) Item limitations —\n\n( A ) Prohibited items.\n\n( 1 ) For Cuba no items listed on the Commerce Control List other than items listed in § 740.19(b) of the EAR may be included in a gift parcel.\n\n( 2 ) For all destinations, no items controlled for chemical and biological weapons (CB), missile technology (MT), national security (NS), nuclear proliferation (NP) or encryption items (EI) reasons on the Commerce Control List (supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) may be included in a gift parcel.\n\n( 3 ) Items prohibited for destinations in Country Group D:1 or E:2. For destinations in Country Group D:1 or E:2, military wearing apparel may not be included in a gift parcel regardless of whether all distinctive U.S. military insignia, buttons, and other markings are removed.\n\n( 4 ) Gold bullion, gold taels, and gold bars are prohibited as are items intended for resale or reexport.\n\n( B ) Eligible items. For all destinations, eligible items are food (including vitamins); medicines, medical supplies and devices (including hospital supplies and equipment and equipment for the handicapped); receive-only radio equipment for reception of commercial/civil AM/FM and short wave publicly available frequency bands, and batteries for such equipment; clothing; personal hygiene items; seeds; veterinary medicines and supplies; fishing equipment and supplies; soap-making equipment; as well as all other items of a type normally sent as gifts between individuals (including items listed in § 740.19(b) of the EAR) except for those items prohibited in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) of this section. Items in gift parcels must be in quantities normally given as gifts between individuals.\n\nExample to paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) of this section. A watch or piece of jewelry is normally sent as a gift. However, multiple watches, either in one package or in subsequent shipments, would not qualify for such gift parcels because the quantity would exceed that normally given between individuals. Similarly, a sewing machine or bicycle within the value limit of this License Exception may be an appropriate gift. However, subsequent shipments of the same item to the same donee would not be a gift normally given between individuals.\n\n( ii ) Import requirements. The commodities must be acceptable in type and quantity by the recipient country for import as gifts.

Note that encryption software subject to the EAR is not subject to the General Software Note (see paragraph (d)(2) of this section).\n\n( a ) Operation technology and software —\n\n( 1 ) Scope. The provisions of paragraph (a) permit exports and reexports of operation technology and software. “Operation technology” is the minimum technology necessary for the installation, operation, maintenance (checking), or repair of those commodities or software that are lawfully exported or reexported under a license, a License Exception, or NLR. The “minimum necessary” operation technology does not include technology for development or production and includes use technology only to the extent required to ensure safe and efficient use of the commodity or software. Individual entries in the software and technology subcategories of the CCL may further restrict the export or reexport of operation technology. This paragraph (a) authorizes training, provided the training is limited to the operation, maintenance and repair technology identified in this paragraph.\n\n( 2 ) Provisions and destinations —\n\n( i ) Provisions. Operation software may be exported or reexported provided that both of the following conditions are met:\n\n( A ) The operation software is the minimum necessary to operate equipment authorized for export or reexport; and\n\n( B ) The operation software is in object code.\n\n( ii ) Destinations. Operation software and technology may be exported or reexported to any destination to which the equipment for which it is required has been or is being legally exported or reexported.\n\n( b ) Sales technology —\n\n( 1 ) Scope. The provisions of paragraph (b) authorize exports and reexports of sales technology. “Sales technology” is data supporting a prospective or actual quotation, bid, or offer to sell, lease, or otherwise supply any item.\n\n( 2 ) Provisions and destinations —\n\n( i ) Provisions. Sales technology may be exported or reexported provided that:\n\n( A ) The technology is a type customarily transmitted with a prospective or actual quotation, bid, or offer in accordance with established business practice; and\n\n( B ) Neither the export nor the reexport will disclose the detailed design, production, or manufacture technology, or the means of reconstruction, of either the quoted item or its product. The purpose of this limitation is to prevent disclosure of technology so detailed that the consignee could reduce the technology to production.\n\n( ii ) Destinations. Sales technology may be exported or reexported to any destination.\n\nNeither this section nor its use means that the U.S. Government intends, or is committed, to approve a license application for any commodity, plant, software, or technology that may be the subject of the transaction to which such quotation, bid, or offer relates. Exporters are advised to include in any quotations, bids, or offers, and in any contracts entered into pursuant to such quotations, bids, or offers, a provision relieving themselves of liability in the event that a license (when required) is not approved by the Bureau of Industry and Security.\n\n( c ) Software updates. The provisions of paragraph (c) authorize exports and reexports of software updates that are intended for and are limited to correction of errors (“fixes” to “bugs”) in software lawfully exported or reexported (original software). Such software updates may be exported or reexported only to the same consignee to whom the original software was exported or reexported, and such software updates may not enhance the functional capacities of the original software. Such software updates may be exported or reexported to any destination to which the software for which they are required has been legally exported or reexported.\n\n( d ) General Software Note: mass market software —\n\n( 1 ) Scope. The provisions of paragraph (d) authorize exports and reexports of mass market software subject to the General Software Note (see supplement no. 2 to part 774 of the EAR; also referenced in this section). [ 2 ]\n\n( 2 ) Exclusions. The provisions of this paragraph (d) are not available for encryption software controlled for “EI” reasons under ECCN 5D002 or for encryption software with symmetric key length exceeding 64-bits that qualifies as mass market encryption software under the criteria in the Cryptography Note (Note 3) of Category 5, Part 2, of the CCL (supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR). (Once such mass market encryption software has been released from “EI” and “NS” controls pursuant to § 740.17(b) of the EAR, it is controlled under ECCN 5D992.c and is thus outside the scope of License Exception TSU.) See § 740.17(b) of the EAR for exports and reexports of mass market encryption products controlled under ECCN 5D992.c. The provisions of this paragraph (d) are also not available for any software that is controlled for missile technology (MT) reasons.\n\n( 3 ) Provisions and destinations —\n\n( i ) Destinations. Mass market software is available to all destinations except destinations in Country Group E:1 (see supplement no. 1 to this part).\n\n( ii ) Provisions. Mass market treatment is available for software that is generally available to the public by being:\n\n( A ) Sold from stock at retail selling points, without restriction, by means of:\n\n( 1 ) Over the counter transactions;\n\n( 2 ) Mail order transactions; or\n\n( 3 ) Telephone call transactions; and\n\n( B ) Designed for installation by the user without further substantial support by the supplier.\n\n( e ) [Reserved]",

This License Exception ENC does not authorize export or reexport to, transfer (in-country) in, or provision of any service in any country listed in Country Groups E:1 or E:2 in supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR, or release of source code or technology to any national of a country listed in Country Groups E:1 or E:2. Reexports and transfers (in-country) under License Exception ENC are subject to the criteria set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. Paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section set forth information about classifications required by this section. Items described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(3)(i) , (b)(3)(ii) or (b)(3)(iv) of this section that meet the criteria set forth in Note 3 to Category 5—Part 2 of the Commerce Control List (the “mass market” note) are classified under ECCN 5A992 or 5D992 following self-classification or classification by BIS and are no longer subject to “EI” and “NS” controls. Paragraph (e) sets forth reporting required by this section. For items exported under paragraphs (b)(1) , (b)(3)(i) , (ii) , or (iv) of this section and therefore excluded from paragraph (e) reporting requirements, exporters are reminded of the recordkeeping requirements in part 762 of the EAR and that they may be required to make such records available upon request. All classification requests, and reports submitted to BIS pursuant to this section for encryption items will be reviewed by the ENC Encryption Request Coordinator, Ft. Meade, MD.\n\n( a ) No classification request or reporting required. License Exception ENC authorizes the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) to the end users and for the end uses set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, without submission of a classification request, self-classification report or sales report to BIS.\n\n( 1 ) Certain exports, reexports, transfers (in-country) to 'private sector end users' —\n\n( i ) Internal “development” or “production” of new products. License Exception ENC authorizes certain exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of items described in paragraph (a) of this section for the internal “development” or “production” of new products by 'private sector end users,' wherever located, that are headquartered in a country listed in supplement no. 3 of this part.\n\n( ii ) Certain exports, reexports, transfers (in-country) to related parties, not involving “development” or “production” of new products. For internal end uses among 'private sector end users' other than the “development” or “production” of new products, License Exception ENC authorizes exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of non-U.S.-origin items, described in paragraph (a) of this section, to 'private sector end users' wherever located provided that:\n\n( A ) That item became subject to the EAR after it was produced;\n\n( B ) All parties to the transaction are subsidiaries of the same parent company headquartered in a country listed in supplement no. 3 of this part; and\n\n( C ) The characteristics or capabilities of the existing item are not enhanced, unless otherwise authorized by license or license exception.\n\nA 'private sector end user' is either: An individual who is not acting on behalf of any foreign government; or a commercial firm (including its subsidiary and parent firms, and other subsidiaries of the same parent) that is not wholly owned by, otherwise controlled by or acting on behalf of, any foreign government.\n\n( 2 ) Exports, reexports, transfers (in-country) to “U.S. Subsidiaries.” License Exception ENC authorizes export, reexport, and transfer (in-country) of items described in paragraph (a) of this section to any “U.S. subsidiary,” wherever located. License Exception ENC also authorizes export, reexport, transfer (in-country) of such items by a U.S. company and its subsidiaries to foreign nationals who are employees, individual contractors or interns of a U.S. company or its subsidiaries if the items are for internal company use, including the “development” or “production” of new products, without prior review by the U.S. Government.\n\nAll items produced or developed with items exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) under paragraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section are subject to the EAR. These items may require the submission of a classification request before sale, reexport or transfer to non-“U.S. subsidiaries,” unless otherwise authorized by license or license exception.\n\n( 3 ) Reexports and transfers (in-country) of non-U.S. products developed with or incorporating U.S.-origin encryption source code, components, or toolkits. License Exception ENC authorizes the reexport and transfer (in-country) of non-U.S. products developed with or incorporating U.S.-origin encryption source code, components or toolkits that are subject to the EAR, provided that the U.S.-origin encryption items have previously been classified or reported and authorized by BIS and the cryptographic functionality has not been changed. Such products include non-U.S. developed products that are designed to operate with U.S. products through a cryptographic interface.\n\nThis exception from classification and reporting requirements does not apply to non-U.S.-origin products exported from the United States.",

License Exception AGR permits the export of agricultural commodities to Cuba, as well as the reexport of U.S. origin agricultural commodities to Cuba, provided your transaction meets all of the following criteria:\n\n( 1 ) The commodity meets the definition of “agricultural commodities” in part 772 of the EAR;\n\n( 2 ) The commodity is EAR99. You must have an official commodity classification of EAR99 from BIS for fertilizers, western red cedar and live horses before you submit a notification under this license exception. See § 748.3 of the EAR for information on how to submit a commodity classification request;\n\n( 3 ) The export or reexport is made pursuant to a written contract, except for donations and commercial samples which are not subject to this contract requirement;\n\n( 4 ) The export or reexport is made within 12 months of the signing of the contract or within 12 months of notification that no objections were raised (if no contract is required). In the case of multiple partial shipments, all such shipments must be made within the 12 months of the signing of the contract or within 12 months of notification that no objections were raised (if no contract is required); and\n\n( 5 ) You notify BIS prior to exporting or reexporting according to the procedures set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. If you intend to engage in multiple shipments during the one-year period after the signing of the contract, you need only notify BIS prior to the first shipment.\n\n( b ) Restrictions.\n\n( 1 ) No export or reexport to any individual or entity designated as a Specially Designated Terrorist or Foreign Terrorist Organization may be made under License Exception AGR (see part 744 of the EAR).\n\n( 2 ) No export or reexport to or for use in biological, chemical, nuclear warfare or missile proliferation activities may be made under License Exception AGR (see part 744 of the EAR).\n\n( 3 ) No U.S.-owned or controlled foreign firm may export from abroad to Cuba a foreign produced agricultural commodity containing more than 25% U.S.-origin content. Such U.S.-owned or controlled foreign firms require a specific license from BIS as well as the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Transactions not subject to the EAR (under 25% U.S.-origin content) require a license from OFAC.\n\n( c ) Prior notification —\n\n( 1 ) General requirement. You must notify BIS prior to any export or reexport (or prior to the first of multiple shipments) under License Exception AGR.\n\n( 2 ) Procedures. You must provide prior notification of exports and reexports under License Exception AGR by submitting a completed application in accordance with § 748.1 of the EAR. The following blocks must be completed, as appropriate: Blocks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (by marking box 5 “Other”), 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22 (a), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), 23, and 25 according to the instructions described in supplement no. 1 to part 748 of the EAR. If your commodity is fertilizer, western red cedar or live horses, you must confirm that BIS has previously classified your commodity as EAR99 by placing the Commodity Classification Automatic Tracking System (CCATS) number in Block 22(d). BIS will not initiate the registration of an AGR notification unless the application is complete.\n\n( 3 ) Action by BIS. Within two business days of the registration of the AGR notification, BIS will refer the notification for interagency review, or if necessary return the notification without action (e.g., if the information provided is incomplete). Registration is defined as the point at which the notification is entered into BIS's electronic system.\n\n( 4 ) Review by other departments or agencies. The Departments of Defense, State, and other agencies, as appropriate, may review the AGR notification. BIS must receive department or agency objections within nine business days of the referral. Unlike the provisions described in § 750.4(b) of the EAR, there are no provisions for stopping the processing time of the AGR notification. If, within 11 business days after the date of registration, any reviewing agency provides a written objection that the recipient may promote international terrorism or the transaction raises nonproliferation concerns, you may not use License Exception AGR. In such cases, BIS will notify you that a license is required for the export or reexport. BIS will then process the AGR notification as a license application in accordance with the provisions described in § 750.4 of the EAR, and the licensing policies set forth in the EAR. At this time, BIS may request additional information. When BIS confirms that no agency has raised an objection within eleven business days (as described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section), you may proceed with the transaction provided that you satisfy all other requirements of License Exception AGR, including the requirement to have a written contract prior to any shipment (unless a donation or commercial sample). (Note that the fact that you have been advised that no agency has objected to the transaction does not exempt you from other licensing requirements under the EAR, such as those based on knowledge of a prohibited end-use or end-user as referenced in general prohibition five (part 736 of the EAR) and set forth in part 744 of the EAR.)",

In such cases, BIS will notify you that a license is required for the export or reexport. BIS will then process the AGR notification as a license application in accordance with the provisions described in § 750.4 of the EAR, and the licensing policies set forth in the EAR.

For example, for “600 series” items authorized under License Exception STA, such items must be provided to an eligible ultimate end user, such as a Country Group A:5 military, to stay in compliance with the original authorization. This requirement for the “600 series” is referred to as 'completing the chain,' meaning regardless of how many times the “600 series” item is transferred (in-country) or whether the “600 series” item is incorporated into higher level assemblies or other items, the “600 series” item must ultimately be provided to an eligible ultimate end user, or be otherwise authorized under the EAR. This applies regardless of whether the “600 series” item has been incorporated into a foreign-made item that may no longer be “subject to the EAR.” Because the other items eligible for authorization under License Exception STA (9x515 and other non-600 series ECCNs) do not include the “600 series” requirements specific to ultimate end user, this 'completing the chain' concept does not apply to 9x515 and other non-600 series ECCNs authorized under License Exception STA. However, the original export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) made under License Exception STA for 9x515 and other non-600 series ECCNs still must comply with the original authorization—meaning the terms and conditions of License Exception STA.",

This section authorizes exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country), including releases within a single country of software source code and technology to foreign nationals, in lieu of a license that would otherwise be required pursuant to part 742 of the EAR.\n\nLicense Exception STA authorizes transfers (in-country) but is only needed to authorize a transfer (in-country) when an EAR authorization is required. If a transfer (in-country) is not being made under STA, the requirements specified in this section do not apply (see Note 1 to paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section for requirements specific to staying within the scope of the original License Exception STA authorization and the concept of 'completing the chain' for purposes of “600 series” items originally authorized under License Exception STA).",

For example, for “600 series” items authorized under License Exception STA, such items must be provided to an eligible ultimate end user, such as a Country Group A:5 military, to stay in compliance with the original authorization. This requirement for the “600 series” is referred to as 'completing the chain,' meaning regardless of how many times the “600 series” item is transferred (in-country) or whether the “600 series” item is incorporated into higher level assemblies or other items, the “600 series” item must ultimately be provided to an eligible ultimate end user, or be otherwise authorized under the EAR. This applies regardless of whether the “600 series” item has been incorporated into a foreign-made item that may no longer be “subject to the EAR.” Because the other items eligible for authorization under License Exception STA (9x515 and other non-600 series ECCNs) do not include the “600 series” requirements specific to ultimate end user, this 'completing the chain' concept does not apply to 9x515 and other non-600 series ECCNs authorized under License Exception STA. However, the original export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) made under License Exception STA for 9x515 and other non-600 series ECCNs still must comply with the original authorization—meaning the terms and conditions of License Exception STA.",

For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2) , a log or other record is not required for intangible ( i.e., electronic or in an otherwise intangible form) exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) made under License Exception STA, but an exporter, reexporter, or transferor is required, prior to making any export, reexport, or transfer (in-country), to ensure that a prior consignee statement has been obtained pursuant to the requirements of this paragraph (d)(2) . ( See Note 1 to paragraph (d)(3) of this section for additional guidance on intangible exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country), including best practices). Paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section are required for all transactions. In addition, paragraph (d)(2)(vii) is required for all transactions in “600 series” items and paragraph (viii) of this section is required for transactions in “600 series” items if the consignee is not the government of a country listed in Country Group A:5 (See supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR). Paragraph (d)(2)(viii) is also required for transactions including 9x515 items.",

In determining the actual selling price or the current market price of the commodity, the value of containers in which the commodity is being exported may be excluded. The value for LVS purposes is that of the controlled commodity that is being exported, and may not be reduced by subtracting the value of any content that would not, if shipped separately, be subject to licensing. Where the total value of the containers and their contents must be shown on Shipper's Export Declarations under one Schedule B Number, the exporter, in effecting a shipment under this License Exception, must indicate the “net value” of the contained commodity immediately below the description of the commodity.\n\n( 3 ) Single shipment. All commodities moving at the same time from one exporter to one consignee or intermediate consignee on the same exporting carrier even though these commodities will be forwarded to one or more ultimate consignees. Commodities being transported in this manner will be treated as a single shipment even if the commodities represent more than one order or are in separate containers.\n\n( d ) Additional eligibility requirements and restrictions —\n\n( 1 ) Eligible orders. To be eligible for this License Exception, orders must meet the following criteria:\n\n( i ) Orders must not exceed the applicable “LVS” dollar value limits. An order is eligible for shipment under LVS when the “net value” of the commodities controlled under the same entry on the CCL does not exceed the amount specified in the “LVS” paragraph for that entry. An LVS shipment may include more than one eligible order.\n\n( ii ) Orders may not be split to meet the applicable LVS dollar limits. An order that exceeds the applicable LVS dollar value limit may not be misrepresented as two or more orders, or split among two or more shipments, to give the appearance of meeting the applicable LVS dollar value limit. However an order that meets all the LVS eligibility requirements, including the applicable LVS dollar value limit, may be split among two or more shipments.\n\n( iii ) Orders must be legitimate. Exporters and consignees may not, either collectively or individually, structure or adjust orders to meet the applicable LVS dollar value limits.\n\n( 2 ) Restriction on annual value of LVS orders. The total value of exports per calendar year to the same ultimate or intermediate consignee of commodities classified under a single ECCN may not exceed 12 times the LVS value limit for that ECCN; however, there is no restriction on the number of shipments provided that value is not exceeded. This annual value limit applies to shipments to the same ultimate consignee even though the shipments are made through more than one intermediate consignee. There is no restriction on the number of orders that may be included in a shipment, except that the annual value limit per ECCN must not be exceeded.\n\n( 3 ) Orders where two or more LVS dollar value limits apply. An order may include commodities that are controlled under more than one entry on the CCL. In this case, the net value of the entire order may exceed the LVS dollar value for any single entry on the CCL. However, the net value of the commodities controlled under each ECCN entry shall not exceed the LVS dollar value limit specified for that entry.\n\nExample to paragraph (d)(3): An order includes commodities valued at $8,000. The order consists of commodities controlled under two ECCN entries, each having an LVS value limit of $5000. Commodities in the order controlled under one ECCN are valued at $3,500 while those controlled under the other ECCN are valued at $4,500. Since the net value of the commodities controlled under each entry falls within the LVS dollar value limits applicable to that entry, the order may be shipped under this License Exception.\n\n( 4 ) Prohibition against evasion of license requirements. Any activity involving the use of this License Exception to evade license requirements is prohibited. Such devices include, but are not limited to, the splitting or structuring of orders to meet applicable LVS dollar value limits, as prohibited by paragraphs (d)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section.\n\n( 5 ) Exports and reexports of encryption components or spare parts. For components or spare parts controlled for “EI” reasons under ECCN 5A002, exports and reexports under this License Exception must be destined to support a commodity previously authorized for export or reexport.\n\n( e ) Reexports. Commodities may be reexported under this License Exception, provided that they could be exported from the United States to the new country of destination under LVS.",

An assurance included in a licensing agreement is acceptable only if the agreement specifies that the assurance will be honored even after the expiration date of the licensing agreement. If such a written assurance is not received, License Exception TSR is not applicable and a license is required. The license application must include a statement explaining why assurances could not be obtained.\n\n( 4 ) Other License Exceptions. The requirements in this License Exception do not apply to the export of technology or software under other License Exceptions, or to the export of technology or software included in an application for the foreign filing of a patent, provided the filing is in accordance with the regulations of the U.S. Patent Office.\n\n( b ) Reporting requirements.

Required information to include in the NAC submission is as follows:\n\n( i ) Total Processing Performance of the item, as defined in ECCN 3A090;\n\n( ii ) Performance density of the item, as defined in ECCN 3A090;\n\n( iii ) Data sheet or other documentation showing how the item is designed and marketed (in particular, whether it is designed or marketed for datacenter use);\n\n( iv ) All NAC and license approvals to the end-user in the past 12 months;\n\n( v ) Memory bandwidth of the item(s); and\n\n( vi ) Whether the items are destined for use in a computing cluster, and, if so:\n\n( A ) The computing power of the computing cluster, measured in the aggregate TPP of all chips used in the cluster once the cluster is complete; and\n\n( B ) Whether the cluster will be:\n\n( 1 ) Exclusively for internal use by a company headquartered in the United States or a destination specified in Country Group A:5 or A:6, or\n\n( 2 ) Used by any other companies not headquartered in A:5 or A:6, or by external parties such as through cloud services.\n\n( 2 ) Action by BIS for NAC notifications. After the notification has been registered in SNAP-R and within twenty-five calendar days after registration, BIS will inform you if a license is required. If BIS has not contacted you, then System for Tracking Export License Applications (STELA) ( https://snapr.bis.doc.gov/stela ) will, on the twenty-fifth calendar day following the date of registration, provide either confirmation that you can use License Exception NAC and a NAC confirmation number to be submitted in AES or confirmation that you cannot use License Exception NAC and you must apply for a license to continue with the transaction.\n\n( 3 ) Status of pending NAC notification requests. Log into BIS's STELA for information about the status of your pending NAC notification or to verify the status in BIS's Simplified Network Applications Processing Redesign (SNAP-R) System. STELA will provide the date the NAC notification is registered. BIS may alternatively provide such confirmation of NAC status by email, telephone, fax, courier service, or other means.\n\n( 4 ) Actions that delay processing of NAC notifications. Below are circumstances that will delay the processing of your NAC notification, i.e., temporarily stop the twenty-five day processing clock for NAC notification:\n\n( i ) Lapse in appropriations.\n\n( ii ) Catastrophic event (e.g., an extreme weather event that impacts government services).\n\n( iii ) Multi-day processing system failure.\n\n[ 89 FR 23884 , Apr. 4, 2024, as amended at 89 FR 96814 , Dec. 5, 2024; 90 FR 4558 , Jan. 15, 2025]",

License Exception TMP authorizes exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of items for temporary use abroad (including use in or above international waters) subject to the conditions specified in this paragraph (a) . No item may be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) under this paragraph (a) if an order to acquire the item, such as a purchase order, has been received before shipment; with prior knowledge that the item will stay abroad beyond the terms of this License Exception; or when the item is for subsequent lease or rental abroad. The references to various countries and country groups in these TMP-specific provisions do not limit or amend the prohibitions in § 740.2 of the EAR on the use of license exceptions generally, such as for exports of 9x515 or “600 series” items to destinations in Country Group D:5. This paragraph (a) does not authorize any export of a commodity controlled under ECCNs 0A501.a or .b, 0A506 or 0A507, or shotguns with a barrel length less than 18 inches controlled under ECCN 0A502 or 0A508 to, or any export of such an item that was imported into the United States from, a country in Country Group D:5 (supplement no. 1 to this part), or from Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, or Uzbekistan. The only provisions of this paragraph (a) that are eligible for use to export such items are paragraph (a)(5) of this section (“Exhibition and demonstration”) and paragraph (a)(6) of this section (“Inspection, test, calibration, and repair”). In addition, this paragraph (a) may not be used to export more than 75 firearms per shipment. In accordance with the requirements in § 758.1(b)(9) and (g)(4) of the EAR, the exporter or its agent must provide documentation that includes the serial number, make, model, and caliber of each firearm being exported by filing these data elements in an EEI filing in AES. In accordance with the exclusions in License Exception TMP under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the entry clearance requirements in § 758.1(b)(9) do not permit the temporary import of: Firearms controlled in ECCNs 0A501.a or .b, 0A506, or 0A507 that are shipped from or manufactured in a Country Group D:5 country, or that are shipped from or manufactured in Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, or Uzbekistan (except for any firearm model designation (if assigned) controlled by ECCNs 0A501, 0A506, or 0A507 that is specified under annex A in supplement no. 4 to this part); or shotguns with a barrel length less than 18 inches controlled in ECCNs 0A502 or 0A508 that are shipped from or manufactured in a Country Group D:5 country, or from Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, or Uzbekistan, because of the exclusions in License Exception TMP under paragraph (b)(5) of this section.\n\n( 1 ) Tools of trade. Exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) of commodities and software as tools of trade for use by the exporter or employees of the exporter may be made only to destinations other than Country Group E:1 and for MT controlled commodities or software may be made only to destinations other than Country Groups D:4 and D:5. The tools of trade must remain under the “effective control” of the exporter or the exporter's employee. Eligible items are usual and reasonable kinds and quantities of tools of trade for use in a lawful enterprise or undertaking of the exporter. Tools of trade include, but are not limited to, commodities and software as is necessary to commission or service items, provided that the commodity or software is appropriate for this purpose and that all items to be commissioned or serviced are of foreign origin, or if subject to the EAR, have been lawfully exported, reexported, or transferred. Tools of trade may accompany the individual departing from the United States or may be shipped unaccompanied within one month before the individual's departure from the United States, or at any time after departure. Software used as a tool of trade must be protected against unauthorized access. Examples of security precautions to help prevent unauthorized access include the following:\n\n( i ) Use of secure connections, such as Virtual Private Network connections, when accessing IT networks for activities that involve the transmission and use of the software authorized under this license exception;\n\n( ii ) Use of password systems on electronic devices that store the software authorized under this license exception; and\n\n( iii ) Use of personal firewalls on electronic devices that store the software authorized under this license exception.\n\n( 2 ) [Reserved]\n\n( 3 ) “Technology,” regardless of media or format, may be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) by or to a U.S. person, or a foreign person employee of a U.S. person traveling or on temporary assignment abroad, subject to the following restrictions:\n\n( i ) Foreign persons may only export, reexport, transfer (in country) or receive such “technology” as they are authorized to receive through a license, license exception other than TMP or because no license is required.",

      "text": "15 CFR 742.1\n§ 742.1 Introduction.\n\nIn this part, references to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) are references to 15 CFR chapter VII , subchapter C.\n\n( a ) Scope. This part describes all the reasons for control reflected in the Country Chart in supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR. In addition, it includes licensing requirements and licensing policies for the following items that are not reflected on the Country Chart: specially designed implements of torture, high performance computers, and communications intercepting devices. In addition to describing the reasons for control and licensing requirements and policies, this part describes any applicable contract sanctity provisions that may apply to specific controls and includes a description of any multilateral regime under which specific controls are maintained.\n\n( b ) Reasons for control listed on the CCL not covered by this part. This part describes the license requirements and the licensing policies for all the “Reasons for Control” that are listed on the Commerce Control List (CCL) except “Short Supply” and “U.N. Sanctions,” which do not appear on the Country Chart.\n\n( 1 ) Short supply. ECCNs containing items subject to short supply controls (“SS”) refer the exporter to part 754 of the EAR. These ECCNs are: 0A980 (Horses for export by sea); 1C980 (certain inorganic chemicals); 1C982 (certain other petroleum products); 1C983 (certain natural gas liquids and other natural gas derivatives); 1C984 (certain manufactured gas and synthetic natural gas (except when commingled with natural gas and thus subject to export authorization from the Department of Energy); and 1C988 (Unprocessed western red cedar (thuja plicata) logs and timber, and rough, dressed and worked lumber containing wane).\n\n( 2 ) U.N. Sanctions. The United Nations imposes sanctions, short of complete embargoes, against certain countries which may result in controls that supplement those otherwise maintained under the EAR for that particular country. This part does not address license requirements and licensing policies for controls implementing U.N. sanctions. CCL entries containing items subject to U.N. sanctions will refer the exporter to part 746 of the EAR, Embargoes and Other Special Controls, for any supplemental controls that may apply to exports and reexports involving these countries.\n\n( c ) Exports and reexports involving Cuba and Iran. This part does not cover license requirements and licensing policies that apply to exports and reexports to embargoed destinations (Cuba and Iran). These comprehensive embargoes cover a broader range of items than those reflected in the CCL. If you are exporting or reexporting to any of these destinations, you should first review part 746 of the EAR, Embargoes and Other Special Controls.\n\n( d ) Anti-terrorism Controls on Iran, North Korea, and Syria. Commerce maintains anti-terrorism controls on Iran, North Korea, and Syria under section 6(a) of the Export Administration Act. Items controlled under section 6(a) to Iran, Syria, and North Korea are described in §§ 742.8 , 742.9 , 742.10 , and 742.19 , respectively, and in Supplement No. 2 to part 742. Commerce also maintains controls under section 6(j) of the EAA to Iran, North Korea, and Syria. Items controlled to these countries under EAA section 6(j) are also described in Supplement 2 to part 742. The Secretaries of Commerce and State are required to notify appropriate Committees of the Congress 30 days before issuing a license for an item controlled under section 6(j) to North Korea, Iran, or Syria. If you are exporting or reexporting to Iran, North Korea, or Syria, you should review part 746 of the EAR, Embargoes and Other Special Controls.\n\n( e ) End-user and end-use based controls. This part does not cover prohibitions and licensing requirements for exports of items not included on the CCL that are subject to end-use and end-user controls: certain nuclear end-uses; certain missile end-uses; certain chemical and biological weapons end-uses; certain naval nuclear propulsion end-uses; certain activities of U.S. persons; and certain exports to and for the use of certain foreign vessels and aircraft. Licensing requirements and policies for these exports are contained in part 744 of the EAR.\n\n( f ) Overlapping license policies. Many items on the CCL are subject to more than one type of control (e.g., national security (NS), missile technology (MT), nuclear nonproliferation (NP), regional stability (RS)). In addition, applications for all items on the CCL, other than those controlled for short supply reasons, may be reviewed for missile technology (see § 742.5(b)(3) of this part ), nuclear nonproliferation (see § 742.3(b)(2) of this part ), or chemical and biological weapons (see § 742.2(b)(3) of this part ), if the end-use or end-user may be involved in certain proliferation activities. Finally, many multilaterally controlled items are reviewed for anti-terrorism reasons if they are destined for a terrorism-supporting country (see paragraph (d) of this section). Your application for a license will be reviewed under all applicable licensing policies. A license will be issued only if an application can be approved under all applicable licensing policies.\n\n[ 61 FR 12786 , Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 25458 , May 9, 1997; 65 FR 38151 , June 19, 2000; 69 FR 23629 , Apr. 29, 2004; 69 FR 46075 , July 30, 2004; 71 FR 51717 , Aug. 31, 2006; 72 FR 3725 , Jan. 26, 2007; 76 FR 77117 , Dec. 12, 2011; 79 FR 34410 , June 17, 2014; 80 FR 43318 , July 22, 2015; 81 FR 29486 , May 12, 2016; 86 FR 4933 , Jan. 19, 2021]",

These items include any electronic, mechanical, or other device primarily useful for the surreptitious interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications (ECCNs 5A001.f.1 and 5A980); and for related “software” primarily useful for the surreptitious interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications (ECCN 5D001.c and 5D980.a); and “software” primarily useful for the “development”, “production”, or “use” of devices controlled under ECCNs 5A001.f.1 and 5A980 (ECCNs 5D001.a and 5D980.b); and for “technology” primarily useful for the “development”, “production”, or “use” of items controlled by ECCNs 5A001.f.1, 5D001.a (for 5A001.f.1), 5A980 and 5D980 (ECCNs 5E001.a and 5E980); and for “software” primarily useful to support such ECCN 5E001.a “development”, “production”, or “use” “technology” for 5A001.f.1 equipment and certain 5D001.a “software” (ECCN 5D001.b). These licensing requirements do not supersede the requirements contained in the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, as amended ( 18 U.S.C. 2512 ). This license requirement is not reflected on the Commerce Country Chart (supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR).\n\n( 2 ) “Communications intercepting devices” are electronic, mechanical, or other devices that can be used for interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications if their design renders them primarily useful for surreptitious listening even though they may also have innocent uses. A device is not restricted merely because it is small or may be adapted to wiretapping or eavesdropping. Some examples of devices to which these restrictions apply are: the martini olive transmitter; the infinity transmitter; the spike mike; and the disguised microphone appearing as a wristwatch, cufflink, or cigarette pack; etc. The restrictions do not apply to devices such as the parabolic microphone or other directional microphones ordinarily used by broadcasters at sports events, since these devices are not primarily useful for surreptitious listening.\n\n( b ) Licensing policy.\n\n( 1 ) License applications, except for those applications for which a license is required for both SL and AT reasons, will generally be approved for exports or reexports requiring a license for SL reasons when the exporter or reexporter is:\n\n( i ) A provider of wire or electronic communication services or an officer, agent, or employee of, or person under contract with such a provider, in the normal course of the business of providing that wire or electronic communication service; or\n\n( ii ) An officer, agent, or employee of, or a person under contract with, the United States, one of the 50 States, or a political subdivision thereof, when engaged in the normal course of government activities.\n\nFor SL reasons, license applications will generally be denied to countries that are subject to controls for AT reasons.\n\nThe normal course of the business of providing a wire or electronic communications service includes any activity which is a necessary incident to the rendition of the service or to the protection of the rights and property of the provider of that service.\n\n( 2 ) Other license applications will generally be denied for exports or reexports requiring a license for SL reasons.\n\n( c ) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are not available for license applications involving exports and reexports of communications interception devices.\n\n( d ) U.S. controls. Controls on items classified under ECCNs 5A980, 5D980, and 5E980 are maintained by the United States government for foreign policy purposes.\n\n[ 61 FR 12786 , Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 71 FR 67036 , Nov. 20, 2006; 77 FR 39368 , July 2, 2012; 78 FR 37382 , June 20, 2013; 89 FR 28600 , Apr. 19, 2024]",

      "text": "15 CFR 742.15\n§ 742.15 Encryption items.\n\nEncryption items can be used to maintain the secrecy of information, and thereby may be used by persons abroad to harm U.S. national security, foreign policy and law enforcement interests. The United States has a critical interest in ensuring that important and sensitive information of the public and private sector is protected. Consistent with our international obligations as a member of the Wassenaar Arrangement, the United States has a responsibility to maintain control over the export and reexport of encryption items. As the President indicated in Executive Order 13026 and in his Memorandum of November 15, 1996, exports and reexports of encryption software, like exports and reexports of encryption hardware, are controlled because of this functional capacity to encrypt information, and not because of any informational or theoretical value that such software may reflect, contain, or represent, or that its export or reexport may convey to others abroad. For this reason, export controls on encryption software are distinguished from controls on other software regulated under the EAR.\n\n( a ) Licensing requirements and policy —\n\n( 1 ) Licensing requirements. A license is required to export or reexport encryption items (“EI”) classified under ECCN 5A002, 5A004, 5D002.a, .c.1 or .d (for equipment and “software” in ECCNs 5A002 or 5A004, 5D002.c.1); or 5E002 for “technology” for the “development,” “production,” or “use” of commodities or “software” controlled for EI reasons in ECCNs 5A002, 5A004 or 5D002, and “technology” classified under 5E002.b to all destinations, except Canada. Refer to part 740 of the EAR, for license exceptions that apply to certain encryption items, and to § 772.1 of the EAR for definitions of encryption items and terms. Most encryption items may be exported under the provisions of License Exception ENC set forth in § 740.17 of the EAR. Following classification or self-classification, items that meet the criteria of Note 3 to Category 5—Part 2 of the Commerce Control List (the “mass market” note), are classified under ECCN 5A992 or 5D992 and are no longer subject to this Section (see § 740.17 of the EAR). Before submitting a license application, please review License Exception ENC to determine whether this license exception is available for your item or transaction. For exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) of encryption items that are not eligible for a license exception, you must submit an application to obtain authorization under a license or an Encryption Licensing Arrangement.\n\n( 2 ) Licensing policy. Applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by BIS, in conjunction with other agencies, to determine whether the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) is consistent with U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. Encryption Licensing Arrangements (ELAs) may be authorized for exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) of unlimited quantities of encryption commodities and software described in § 740.17 (b)(2)(i)(A) that have been classified by BIS to “more sensitive government end users,” in all destinations, except countries listed in Country Groups E:1 or E:2 of supplement no. 1 to part 740. ELAs for “more sensitive government end users” may be authorized for encryption commodities and software described in § 740.17(b)(2)(ii) through (iv) under certain circumstances. ELAs are valid for four years and may require pre-shipment notification. Applicants seeking authorization for Encryption Licensing Arrangements must specify the sales territory on their license applications.\n\n( b ) Publicly available encryption source code —\n\n( 1 ) Scope and eligibility. Subject to the notification requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, publicly available (see § 734.3(b)(3) of the EAR) encryption source code classified under ECCN 5D002 is not subject to the EAR. Such source code is publicly available even if it is subject to an express agreement for the payment of a licensing fee or royalty for commercial production or sale of any product developed using the source code.\n\n( 2 ) Notification requirement for “non-standard cryptography.” For publicly available encryption source code classified under ECCN 5D002 that provides or performs “non-standard cryptography” as defined in part 772 of the EAR, you must notify BIS and the ENC Encryption Request Coordinator via email of the internet location ( e.g., URL or internet address) of the source code or provide each of them a copy of the publicly available encryption source code. If you update or modify the source code, you must also provide additional copies to each of them each time the cryptographic functionality of the source code is updated or modified. In addition, if you posted the source code on the internet, you must notify BIS and the ENC Encryption Request Coordinator each time the internet location is changed, but you are not required to notify them of updates or modifications made to the encryption source code at the previously notified location. In all instances, submit the notification or copy to crypt@bis.doc.gov and to enc@nsa.gov .\n\n[ 73 FR 57507 , Oct. 3, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 36494 , June 25, 2010; 75 FR 43821 , July 27, 2010; 76 FR 1063 , Jan. 7, 2011; 76 FR 29619 , May 20, 2011; 78 FR 13469 , Feb. 28, 2013; 78 FR 37383 , June 20, 2013; 81 FR 64673 , Sept. 20, 2016; 86 FR 16488 , Mar. 29, 2021; 88 FR 73494 , Oct. 25, 2023; 89 FR 23885 , Apr. 4, 2024]",

Following classification or self-classification, items that meet the criteria of Note 3 to Category 5—Part 2 of the Commerce Control List (the “mass market” note), are classified under ECCN 5A992 or 5D992 and are no longer subject to this Section (see § 740.17 of the EAR). Before submitting a license application, please review License Exception ENC to determine whether this license exception is available for your item or transaction. For exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) of encryption items that are not eligible for a license exception, you must submit an application to obtain authorization under a license or an Encryption Licensing Arrangement.",

Section 309(c) of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 requires BIS to identify items subject to the EAR that could be of significance for nuclear explosive purposes if used for activities other than those authorized at the time of export or reexport. ECCNs on the CCL that include the symbol “NP 1” or “NP 2” in the “Country Chart” column of the “License Requirements” section identify items that could be of significance for nuclear explosive purposes and are therefore subject to licensing requirements under this part and under section 309(c) of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978. These items are referred to as “The Nuclear Referral List” and are subject to the following licensing requirements:\n\n( 1 ) If NP Column 1 of the Country Chart (supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) is indicated in the appropriate ECCN, a license is required to all destinations, except those Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) member countries that are listed under Country Group A:4 in supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR.\n\n( 2 ) If NP Column 2 of the Country Chart (supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) is indicated in the applicable ECCN, a license is required when the item is destined to a Country Group D:2 (see supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) country, China (the People's Republic of), or Macau.\n\n( 3 ) Other nuclear-related license requirements are described in §§ 744.2 and 744.5 of the EAR.\n\n( b ) Licensing policy.\n\n( 1 ) To implement the controls in paragraph (a) of this section, the following factors are among those used to determine what action should be taken on individual applications:\n\n( i ) Whether the items to be transferred are appropriate for the stated end-use and whether that stated end-use is appropriate for the end-user;\n\n( ii ) The significance for nuclear purposes of the particular item;\n\n( iii ) Whether the items to be exported or reexported are to be used in research on, or for the development, design, manufacture, construction, operation, or maintenance of, any reprocessing or enrichment facility;\n\n( iv ) The types of assurances or guarantees given against use for nuclear explosive purposes or proliferation in the particular case;\n\n( v ) Whether any party to the transaction has been engaged in clandestine or illegal procurement activities;\n\n( vi ) Whether an application for a license to export or reexport to the end-user has previously been denied, or whether the end-user has previously diverted items received under a general license, a License Exception, or a validated license to unauthorized activities;\n\n( vii ) Whether the export or reexport would present an unacceptable risk of diversion to a nuclear explosive activity or unsafeguarded nuclear fuel-cycle activity described in § 744.2(a) of the EAR;\n\n( viii ) The nonproliferation credentials of the importing country, based on consideration of the following factors:\n\n( A ) Whether the importing country is a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) or to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco) or to a similar international legally-binding nuclear nonproliferation agreement;\n\n( B ) Whether the importing country has all of its nuclear activities, facilities, or installations that are operational, being designed, or under construction under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards or equivalent full scope safeguards;\n\n( C ) Whether there is an agreement for cooperation in the civil uses of atomic energy between the U.S. and the importing country;\n\n( D ) Whether the actions, statements, and policies of the government of the importing country are in support of nuclear nonproliferation and whether that government is in compliance with its international obligations in the field of non-proliferation;\n\n( E ) The degree to which the government of the importing country cooperates in non-proliferation policy generally (e.g., willingness to consult on international nonproliferation issues); and\n\n( F ) Information on the importing country's nuclear intentions and activities; and\n\n( ix ) Whether the recipient state has sufficient national export controls (as described in paragraph 3 of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004)) to prevent an unacceptable risk of retransfer or diversion to a nuclear explosive activity or unsafeguarded nuclear fuel-cycle activity described in § 744.2(a) of the EAR.\n\n( 2 ) In addition, BIS will review license applications in accordance with the licensing policy described in paragraph (b) of this section for items not on the Nuclear Referral List that:\n\n( i ) Require a license on the CCL for reasons other than “short supply;” and\n\n( ii ) Are intended for a nuclear related end-use or end-user.\n\n( 3 ) For the People's Republic of China, the general licensing policy for applications for those items that would make a direct and significant contribution to nuclear weapons and their delivery systems is extended review or denial.\n\n( 4 ) License applications for items described in paragraph (a) of this section, when destined for the People's Republic of China will be reviewed in accordance with the licensing policies in both paragraph (b) of this section and § 742.4(b)(7) .

These items are identified in ECCNs on the CCL as MT Column No. 1 in the Country Chart column of the “License Requirements” section. Licenses for these items are required to all destinations, except Australia, Canada, or the United Kingdom, as indicated by MT Column 1 of the Country Chart (see supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR).\n\n( 2 ) The term “missiles” is defined as rocket systems (including ballistic missiles, space launch vehicles, and sounding rockets) and unmanned aerial vehicle systems (including cruise missiles, target drones, and reconnaissance drones) capable of delivering at least 500 kilograms (kg) payload to a range of at least 300 kilometers (km). See § 746.3 of the EAR for definition of a “ballistic missile” to be exported or reexported to Iraq.\n\n( b ) Licensing policy.\n\n( 1 ) Applications to export and reexport items identified in ECCNs on the CCL as MT Column No. 1 in the Country Chart column of the “License Requirements” section will be considered on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the export or reexport would make a material contribution to the proliferation of missiles. Applications for exports and reexports of such items contained in Category 7A or described by ECCN 9A101 on the CCL will be considered favorably if such exports or reexports are destined to a manned aircraft, satellite, land vehicle, or marine vessel, in quantities appropriate for replacement “parts” and “components” for such applications. When an export or reexport is deemed to make a material contribution to the proliferation of missiles, the license will be denied.\n\nApplications to export and reexport an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that has a range and payload capability equal to or greater than 300 km/500 kg but a maximum true airspeed of less than 800 km/hr, and items controlled for Missile Technology reasons for the design, development, production, or use of UAV systems that meet these parameters, will not be subject to a policy of denial but will instead be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the export or reexport will be used in support of WMD activities or military activities contrary to U.S. national security, or whether there is a risk of diversion to support such activities.\n\n( 2 ) The following factors are among those that will be considered in reviewing individual applications.\n\n( i ) The specific nature of the end-use;\n\n( ii ) The significance of the export and reexport in terms of its contribution to the design, development, production, or use of missiles;\n\n( iii ) The capabilities and objectives of the missile and space programs of the recipient country;\n\n( iv ) The nonproliferation credentials of the importing country;\n\n( v ) The types of assurances or guarantees against design, development, production, or use of missiles that are given in a particular case; and\n\n( vi ) The existence of a preexisting contract.\n\n( 3 )\n\n( i ) Consistent with the MTCR Annex General Minimum Software Note, MTCR Annex General Technology Note and § 750.7(c)(1)(x) of the EAR, the approval of any item controlled for MT reasons on a BIS license also authorizes the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) to the same ultimate consignee(s) and end user(s) specified on the license of the minimum “software,” excluding source code, controlled for MT reasons that is required for the installation, operation, maintenance or repair of the item and the “technology” required for the installation, operation, maintenance, or repair of the item in order to ensure the item's safe operation as originally intended. The approval of any item controlled for MT reasons on a BIS license also authorizes the later export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of “software” controlled for MT reasons intended to correct defects (bug fixes) in a previously legally exported item under a BIS license to the same ultimate consignee(s) and end user(s) specified on the license, provided that the capability and/or performance of the item are not otherwise enhanced. This MT licensing policy is implemented concurrent with § 750.7(c)(1)(x) because it applies to all MT licenses, except when a condition is placed on the license which excludes the use of § 750.7(c)(1)(x), as described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.\n\n( ii ) Applicants are not required to identify or provide any support documentation for such minimum “software” or “technology” on a license application for MT controlled items because such minimum “software” or “technology” is authorized within the scope of the license, consistent with § 750.7(c)(1)(x). Applicants will be informed when such minimum “software” and/or “technology” in § 750.7(c)(1)(x) is excluded from the license by a BIS condition on the license, which will state the following: “ This license does not authorize the export, reexport or transfer (in-country) of the minimum “software” and/or “technology” specified in paragraph (c)(1)(x) of § 750.7 (See paragraph (b)(3) of § 742.5 ).”\n\nLicense Exception TSU under § 740.13 of the EAR is available for the ECCNs controlled for MT reasons specified in paragraph (a)(5) in § 740.2, provided the software or technology is for an end use specified in that paragraph and meets the requirements of License Exception TSU. (See §§ 740.2(a)(5) and 740.13). The licensing policy in paragraph (b)(3) is only available for licensed exports (or reexports, or transfers (in-country)).\n\n( 4 ) Controls on other items.

The following controls are maintained in support of U.S. foreign policy to maintain regional stability:\n\n( 1 ) RS Column 1 license requirements in general. A license is required for exports and reexports to all destinations, except Australia, Canada, or the United Kingdom, for all items in ECCNs on the CCL that include RS Column 1 in the Country Chart column of the “License Requirements” section. Transactions described in paragraph (a)(2) , (3) , or (9) of this section are subject to the RS Column 1 license requirements set forth in those paragraphs rather than the license requirements set forth in this paragraph (a)(1) .\n\n( 2 ) Special RS Column 1 license requirements applicable to certain thermal imaging cameras.\n\n( i ) As indicated in the CCL and in RS Column 1 of the Commerce Country Chart, cameras described in 6A003.b.4.b require a license to all destinations other than Australia, Canada, or the United Kingdom if such cameras have a frame rate greater than 60 Hz.\n\n( ii ) Except as noted in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, as indicated in the CCL and in RS Column 1 of the Commerce Country Chart, cameras described in 6A003.b.4.b require a license to all destinations other than Australia, Canada, or the United Kingdom if such cameras incorporate a focal plane array with more than 111,000 elements and a frame rate of 60 Hz or less, or cameras described in 6A003.b.4.b that are being exported or reexported to be embedded in a civil product.\n\n( iii ) BIS may issue licenses for cameras subject to the license requirement of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section that are fully-packaged for use as consumer-ready civil products that, in addition to the specific transactions authorized by such license, authorize exports and reexports of such cameras without a license to any civil end-user to whom such exports or reexport are not otherwise prohibited by U.S. law in a destination in Country Group A:1 (see supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR). The license requirements of this paragraph (a)(2) shall not apply to exports or reexports so authorized. In this paragraph, the term “civil end-user” means any entity that is not a national armed service (army, navy, marine, air force, or coast guard), national guard, national police, government intelligence organization or government reconnaissance organization, or any person or entity whose actions or functions are intended to support “military end-uses” as defined in § 744.17(d) of the EAR.\n\n( iv ) Except as noted in paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section, as indicated in the CCL and in RS Column 1 of the Commerce Country Chart, cameras described in 6A003 b.4.b require a license to all destinations other than Australia, Canada, or the United Kingdom if such cameras incorporate a focal plane array with 111,000 elements or less and a frame rate of 60 Hz or less and are being exported or reexported to be embedded in a civil product.\n\n( v ) BIS may also issue licenses for the cameras described in paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section that, in addition to the specific transactions authorized by such license, authorize exports and reexports to authorized companies described in the license for the purpose of embedding such cameras into a completed product that will be distributed only in countries in Country Group A:1 (see supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR). The license requirements of this paragraph (a)(2) shall not apply to exports or reexports so authorized. In this paragraph, the term “authorized companies” means companies that have been previously licensed for export, are not the subject of relevant negative intelligence or open source information, have not been the subject of a Department of Commerce or Department of State enforcement action within the past two years, have demonstrable production capacity, and do not pose an unacceptable risk of diversion.\n\n( 3 ) Special RS Column 1 license requirement applicable to military commodities. A license is required for reexports to all destinations except Australia, Canada, or the United Kingdom for items classified under ECCN 0A919 except when such items are being reexported as part of a military deployment by a unit of the government of a country in Country Group A:1 (see supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) or the United States.\n\n( 4 ) RS Column 2 license requirements —\n\n( i ) License requirements applicable to most RS Column 2 items. As indicated in the CCL and in RS Column 2 of the Commerce Country Chart (see supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR), a license is required to any destination except those in Country Group A:1 (see supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) and India for all items in ECCNs on the CCL that include RS Column 2 in the Country Chart column of the “License Requirements” section. A license continues to be required for items controlled under ECCNs 6A003.b.4.b and 9A515.e for RS Column 2 reasons when destined to India.\n\n( ii ) Special RS Column 2 license requirements applicable only to certain cameras. As indicated by the CCL, and RS column 2 and footnote number 4 to the Commerce Country Chart, a license is required to any destination except a country in Country Group A:1 (see supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) for fully-packaged thermal imaging cameras for use as consumer-ready civil products controlled by 6A003.b.4.b when incorporating “focal plane arrays” that have not more than 111,000 elements and a frame rate of 60Hz or less and that are not being exported or reexported to be embedded in a civil product.\n\n( 5 ) RS requirements that apply to Iraq. As indicated on the CCL, a license is required for the export or reexport to Iraq or transfer within Iraq of the following items controlled for RS reasons on the CCL: 0B999, 0D999, 1B999, 1C992, 1C995, 1C997, 1C999 and 6A992.

In support of U.S. foreign policy to promote the observance of human rights throughout the world, a license is required to export and reexport crime control and detection equipment, related technology and software as follows:\n\n( 1 ) Crime control and detection instruments and equipment and related “technology” and “software” identified in the appropriate ECCNs on the CCL under CC Column 1 in the Country Chart column of the “License Requirements” section. A license is required to countries listed in CC Column 1 (supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR). Items affected by this requirement are identified on the CCL under the following ECCNs: 0A502 (for shotguns with a barrel length less than 24 inches and shotgun “parts” and “components”), 0A504, 0A505.b, 0A508 (for shotguns with a barrel length less than 24 inches and shotgun “parts” and “components”), 0A509.a (for items for ECCN 0A502 or ECCN 0A508), 0A509.d, 0A977, 0A978, 0A979, 0D977, 0E502, 0E505 (“technology” for “development” or for “production” of buckshot shotgun shells controlled under ECCN 0A505.b), 0E977, 1A984, 1A985, 3A980, 3A981, 3D980, 3E980, 4A003 (for fingerprint computers only), 4A980, 4D001 (for fingerprint computers only), 4D980, 4E001 (for fingerprint computers only), 4E980, 6A002 (for police-model infrared viewers only), 6E001 (for police-model infrared viewers only), 6E002 (for police-model infrared viewers only), and 9A980.\n\n( 2 ) Shotguns with a barrel length greater than or equal to 24 inches, identified in ECCN 0A502 or 0A508 on the CCL under CC Column 2 in the Country Chart column of the “License Requirements” section regardless of end user to countries listed in CC Column 2 (supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR).\n\n( 3 ) Shotguns with barrel length greater than or equal to 24 inches, identified in ECCN 0A502 or 0A508 on the CCL under CC Column 3 in the Country Chart column of the “License Requirements” section only if for sale or resale to police or law enforcement entities in countries listed in CC Column 3 (supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR).\n\n( 4 ) Items designed for the execution of human beings as identified in ECCN 0A981 require a license to all destinations including Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Controls for these items appear in each ECCN; a column specific to these controls does not appear in the Country Chart (supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR).\n\n( 5 ) Certain crime control items require a license to all destinations except Canada. These items are identified under ECCNs 0A982, 0A503, and 0E982. Controls for these items appear in each ECCN; a column specific to these controls does not appear in the Country Chart (supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR).\n\n( 6 ) See § 742.11 of the EAR for further information on items controlled under ECCN 0A983, which require a license to all destinations, including Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Controls for these items appear in each ECCN; a column specific to these controls does not appear in the Country Chart (supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR).\n\n( b ) Licensing policy.\n\n( 1 ) Applications for items controlled under this section will generally be considered favorably on a case-by-case basis, unless there is civil disorder in the country or region or unless there is a risk that the items will be used to violate or abuse human rights. The judicious use of export controls is intended to deter human rights violations and abuses, distance the United States from such violations and abuses, and avoid contributing to civil disorder in a country or region.\n\n( 2 ) BIS will review license applications in accordance with the licensing policy in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for items that are not controlled under this section but that require a license pursuant to another section for any reason other than short supply and could be used by the recipient Government or other end user specifically to violate or abuse human rights.\n\n( c ) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity date: August 22, 2000. Contract sanctity applies only to items controlled under ECCNs 0A982, 0A503, and 0E982 destined for countries not listed in CC Column 1 of the Country Chart (supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR).\n\n( d ) U.S. controls. In maintaining its controls on crime control and detection items, the United States considers international norms regarding human rights and the practices of other countries that control exports to promote the observance of human rights. However, these controls are not based on the decisions of any multinational export control regime and may differ from controls imposed by other countries.\n\n[ 89 FR 34705 , Apr. 30, 2024, as amended at 90 FR 47193 , Sept. 30, 2025]",

      "text": "15 CFR 742.8\n§ 742.8 Anti-terrorism: Iran.\n\n( a ) License requirements.\n\n( 1 ) A license is required for anti-terrorism purposes to export or reexport to Iran any item for which AT column 1 or AT column 2 is indicated in the Country Chart column of the applicable ECCN or any item described in ECCNs 1C350, 1C355, 1C395, 2A994, 2D994 and 2E994. See paragraph (a)(5) of this section for controls maintained by the Department of the Treasury. See § 746.7 of the EAR for additional EAR license requirements that apply to Iran.\n\n( 2 ) [Reserved]\n\n( 3 ) The Secretary of State has designated Iran as a country whose Government has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.\n\n( 4 ) In support of U.S. foreign policy applicable to terrorism-supporting countries, the EAR imposes anti-terrorism license requirements on exports and reexports to Iran pursuant to sections 6(j) and 6(a) of the Export Administration Act.\n\n( i ) Section 6(j) anti-terrorism controls. Section 6(j) requirements apply to all exports and reexports destined to the police, military or other sensitive end-users of items listed on the Commerce Control List (supp. no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) for which any listed reason for control in the applicable ECCN is NS (national security), CB (chemical or biological weapons proliferation), MT (missile proliferation), NP (nuclear weapons proliferation) or an Export Control Classification Number ending in “18” (military related items). BIS may not issue a license for a transaction subject to section 6(j) controls until 30 days after the notification described in Section 6(j)(2) of the Export Administration Act is delivered to the committees of Congress specified in that section. License applications for all other items controlled under section 6(a) are also reviewed to determine whether section 6(j) applies.\n\n( ii ) Section 6(a) anti-terrorism controls. Section 6(a) requirements apply to all exports and reexports regardless of the end user of items described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.\n\n( 5 ) Exports and certain reexports to Iran are subject to a comprehensive embargo administered by the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). If you wish to export or reexport to Iran, the Government of Iran or any entity owned or controlled by that Government, you should review part 746 of the EAR and consult with OFAC. Please note that authorization from OFAC constitutes authorization under the EAR and no separate license or authorization from BIS is required.\n\n( b ) Licensing policy.\n\n( 1 ) The Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of October 23, 1992, requires BIS to deny licenses for items controlled to Iran for national security (section 5 of the 1979 EAA) or foreign policy reasons (section 6 of the 1979 EAA), absent contract sanctity or a Presidential waiver. License applications for which contract sanctity is established may be considered under policies in effect prior to the enactment of that Act. Otherwise, licenses for such items to Iran are subject to a general policy of denial.\n\n( 2 ) License applications for items controlled under section 6(a) of the EAA will also be reviewed to determine whether requirements of section 6(j) apply. Whenever the Secretary of State determines that an export or reexport could make a significant contribution to the military potential of Iran, including its military logistics capability, or could enhance Iran's ability to support acts of international terrorism, the Secretaries of State and Commerce will notify the Congress 30 days prior to the issuance of a license.\n\n( c ) Contract Sanctity. Section 6(f) of the Export Administration Act requires that a report be delivered to Congress before foreign policy based export controls are imposed, expanded or extended. Consistent with section 6(p) of the Export Administration Act, certain exports or reexports in fulfillment of contracts entered into before such delivery of the report applicable to a particular license requirement or licensing policy may be subject to the license requirements and licensing policy that were in force before the report was delivered. License applicants who wish to have their application considered under such pre-existing requirements or policy must include evidence of the pre-existing contract with their license applications.\n\n( d ) U.S. controls. Although the United States seeks cooperation from like-minded countries in maintaining anti-terrorism controls, at this time these controls are maintained only by the United States.\n\n[ 61 FR 12786 , Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 42228 , Aug. 7, 1998; 64 FR 27142 , May 18, 1999; 65 FR 34075 , May 26, 2000; 66 FR 36682 , July 12, 2001; 68 FR 16212 , Apr. 3, 2003; 74 FR 2356 , Jan. 15, 2009]",

This part contains prohibitions against exports, reexports, and selected transfers to certain end users and end uses as introduced under General Prohibitions Five (End use/End users) and Nine (Orders, Terms, and Conditions), unless authorized by BIS. Sections 744.2, 744.3, and 744.4 prohibit exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of items subject to the EAR to defined nuclear, missile, and chemical and biological weapons proliferation activities. Section 744.5 prohibits exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of items subject to the EAR to defined nuclear maritime end-uses. Consistent with General Prohibition Seven (Support of Proliferation Activities and certain Military-Intelligence End Uses and End Users (“U.S. person” activities)), § 744.6 prohibits specific activities by U.S. persons in support of certain nuclear, missile, chemical and biological weapons end uses, and whole plants for chemical weapons precursors, as well as certain military-intelligence end uses and military-intelligence end users. Section 744.7 prohibits exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of certain items for certain aircraft and vessels. Section 744.8 prohibits exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) without authorization when a person designated on the list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List) pursuant to certain specified sanctions programs is a party to the transaction. Section 744.9 sets forth restrictions on exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of certain cameras, systems, or related components. Section 744.11 imposes license requirements, to the extent specified in supplement no. 4 to this part, on entities listed in supplement no. 4 to this part for activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. Section 744.15 sets forth the conditions for exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) to persons listed on the Unverified List (UVL) in supplement no. 6 to this part, the criteria for revising the UVL, as well as procedures for requesting removal or modification of a listing on the UVL. Section 744.16 sets forth the license requirements, policies and procedures for the Entity List. Section 744.17 sets forth restrictions on exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of microprocessors and associated “software” and “technology” for military end uses and to military end users. Section 744.19 sets forth BIS's licensing policy for applications for export, reexport, and transfer (in-country) when a party to the transaction is an entity that has been sanctioned pursuant to any of three specified statutes that require certain license applications to be denied. In addition, these sections include license review standards for export, reexport, and in-country transfer license applications submitted as required by these sections. It should also be noted that part 764 of the EAR prohibits exports, reexports, and certain transfers of items subject to the EAR to denied parties. Section 744.21 imposes restrictions for exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of item subject to the EAR listed in supplement no. 2 to this part for a military end use or military end user in Burma, Cambodia, the People's Republic of China (PRC or China), Nicaragua, or Venezuela and for a Burmese, Cambodian, Chinese, Nicaraguan, or Venezuelan military end user if identified in supplement no. 7 to this part. Section 744.21 also imposes restrictions for exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) for all items subject to the EAR for a military end use or military end user in Belarus or Russia and for a Belarusian or Russian military end user wherever located if identified on supplement no. 4 to this part.

A license is required, to the extent specified on the Entity List, to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) any item subject to the EAR when an entity that is listed on the Entity List, or any entity using an address identified on the Entity List as presenting a high risk of diversion to activities of concern, is a party to the transaction as described in § 748.5(c) through (f) of the EAR unless otherwise authorized or excluded in this section. License exceptions may not be used unless authorized in the Entity List entry for the entity that is party to the transaction or for an address that presents a high diversion risk that is used by a party to the transaction. Applications for licenses required by this section will be evaluated as stated in the relevant Entity List entry, in addition to any other applicable review policy stated elsewhere in the EAR.\n\n( 1 ) Entity List entries extend to other foreign affiliates of listed entities owned 50 percent or more by one or more listed entities or unlisted entities that are subject to ownership-related restrictions. The Entity List license requirements and other Entity List restrictions also apply to any foreign entity that is owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more listed entities or unlisted entities that are subject to Entity List license requirements or other Entity List restrictions based upon their ownership. The Entity List license requirements and other Entity List restrictions do not apply to foreign affiliates that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more entities that are operating at an address listed on the Entity List if the entities operating at that address are not specifically identified on the Entity List. An entity owned 50 percent or more, directly or indirectly, by multiple entities subject to EAR license requirements pursuant to some combination of the Entity List, MEU List, or SDN List designated under programs listed in § 744.8(a)(1) , is subject to the most restrictive license requirements, license exception eligibility, and license review policy applicable to one or more of its owners under the EAR. If an exporter, reexporter, or transferor cannot determine the ownership percentage of a foreign entity that is an entity owned, directly or indirectly, by one or more listed entities, they must resolve the Red Flag or obtain a license from BIS prior to proceeding with the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country), unless a license exception is available (see Red Flag 29 in supplement no. 3 to part 732).\n\n( 2 ) Entity List foreign-“direct product” (FDP) license requirements, review policy, and license exceptions —",

Such circumstances that may place an entity or address that presents a high diversion risk include situations involving a sustained lack of cooperation by a host government authority, for example, by preventing an end-use check from being conducted, that effectively prevents BIS from determining compliance with the EAR.

A license is required, to the extent specified on the Entity List, to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) any item subject to the EAR when an entity that is listed on the Entity List, or any entity using an address identified on the Entity List as presenting a high risk of diversion to activities of concern, is a party to the transaction as described in § 748.5(c) through (f) of the EAR unless otherwise authorized or excluded in this section. License exceptions may not be used unless authorized in the Entity List entry for the entity that is party to the transaction or for an address that presents a high diversion risk that is used by a party to the transaction. Applications for licenses required by this section will be evaluated as stated in the relevant Entity List entry, in addition to any other applicable review policy stated elsewhere in the EAR.\n\n( 1 ) Entity List entries extend to other foreign affiliates of listed entities owned 50 percent or more by one or more listed entities or unlisted entities that are subject to ownership-related restrictions. The Entity List license requirements and other Entity List restrictions also apply to any foreign entity that is owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more listed entities or unlisted entities that are subject to Entity List license requirements or other Entity List restrictions based upon their ownership. The Entity List license requirements and other Entity List restrictions do not apply to foreign affiliates that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more entities that are operating at an address listed on the Entity List if the entities operating at that address are not specifically identified on the Entity List. An entity owned 50 percent or more, directly or indirectly, by multiple entities subject to EAR license requirements pursuant to some combination of the Entity List, MEU List, or SDN List designated under programs listed in § 744.8(a)(1) , is subject to the most restrictive license requirements, license exception eligibility, and license review policy applicable to one or more of its owners under the EAR. If an exporter, reexporter, or transferor cannot determine the ownership percentage of a foreign entity that is an entity owned, directly or indirectly, by one or more listed entities, they must resolve the Red Flag or obtain a license from BIS prior to proceeding with the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country), unless a license exception is available (see Red Flag 29 in supplement no. 3 to part 732).\n\n( 2 ) Entity List foreign-“direct product” (FDP) license requirements, review policy, and license exceptions —\n\n( i ) Footnote 1 entities. You may not, without a license or license exception, reexport, export from abroad, or transfer (in-country) to or within any destination or to any end user or party any foreign-produced item subject to the EAR pursuant to § 734.9(e)(1) of the EAR. All license exceptions described in part 740 of the EAR are available for foreign-produced items that are subject to this license requirement if all terms and conditions of the applicable license exception are met and the restrictions in § 740.2 of this EAR do not apply. The sophistication and capabilities of technology in items is a factor in license application review; license applications for foreign-produced items subject to a license requirement by this paragraph (a)(2) that are capable of supporting the “development” or “production” of telecom systems, equipment, and devices below the 5G level ( e.g., 4G, 3G) will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.\n\n( ii ) [Reserved]\n\n( iii ) Footnote 3 entities. License requirements for foreign-produced items involving entities marked with footnote 3 are described in § 746.8(a)(3) .

You may not, without a license, reexport, export from abroad, or transfer (in-country) to or within any destination or to any end user or party any foreign-produced item subject to the EAR pursuant to § 734.9(e)(2) of the EAR. See § 744.23 for additional license requirements that may apply to these entities. The license review policy for foreign-produced items subject to this license requirement is set forth in the entry in supplement no. 4 to this part for each entity with a footnote 4 designation.\n\n( v ) Footnote 5 entities and end-user facilities where the “production” of logic or DRAM “advanced-node integrated circuits” occurs —\n\n( A ) License requirement.

A license is required for commodities specified in ECCNs 3B001 (except 3B001.a.4, c, d, f.1, f.5, f.6, g, h, k to n, p.2, p.4, or r), 3B002 (except 3B002.c), 3B611, 3B903, 3B991 (except 3B991.b.2.a through 3B991.b.2.b), 3B992, 3B993, or 3B994 when exported from abroad or reexported by an entity headquartered in, or whose ultimate parent company is headquartered in, Macau or a destination specified in Country Group D:5.\n\n( 2 ) Exports from abroad or reexports from countries in Country Group A:5 that are not in supplement no. 4 to part 742.

An entity or address that presents a high diversion risk may pose a significant risk through certain circumstances that may be outside of its own control or in the case of addresses with high diversion risk, outside the control of certain parties to the transaction operating at such address that presents a high diversion risk. Such circumstances that may place an entity or address that presents a high diversion risk include situations involving a sustained lack of cooperation by a host government authority, for example, by preventing an end-use check from being conducted, that effectively prevents BIS from determining compliance with the EAR. This section may not be used to place any U.S. person, as defined in § 772.1 of the EAR, on the Entity List.

In addition to the requirements set forth elsewhere in the EAR, exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) subject to the EAR involving parties to the transaction who are listed on the Unverified List (UVL) must be made in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. The names and addresses of foreign persons subject to end-user controls based on the criteria described in paragraph (c) of this section are identified in the Unverified List found in supplement no. 6 to this part. Requirements found elsewhere in the EAR also apply, including but not limited to any license requirements, the record filing requirements pursuant to § 758.1(b)(8) , and the restrictions on license exceptions described in § 740.2(a)(17) of the EAR.\n\n( b ) UVL statement. Before proceeding with any export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) subject to the EAR that is not subject to a license requirement, involving a person listed on the Unverified List as a party described in § 748.5 of the EAR, an exporter, reexporter, or transferor (in-country) must obtain a UVL statement from such person, according to the provisions set forth in this section. The statement must be retained in accordance with part 762 of the EAR.\n\n( 1 ) One UVL statement may be used for multiple exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of the same items between the same parties, so long as the party names, the description(s) of the items and the ECCNs are correct. If one UVL statement is used for multiple exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country), the exporter, reexporter, and transferor must maintain a log or other record that identifies each export, reexport, and transfer (in-country) made pursuant to this section and the specific UVL statement that is associated with each. The log or record must be retained in accordance with Part 762 of the EAR.\n\n( 2 ) The UVL statement must be in writing, signed and dated by an individual of sufficient authority to legally bind the UVL party, and state the following:\n\n( i ) Name of UVL party; complete physical address, to include shipping, corporate, and end user addresses, if different (simply listing a post office box is insufficient); telephone number; fax number; email address; Web site (if available); and name and title of individual signing the UVL statement.\n\n( ii ) Agrees not to use the item(s) for any use prohibited by the United States Export Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-772 , and agrees not to reexport or transfer (in-country) the item(s) to any destination, use or user prohibited by the EAR.\n\n( iii ) Declares that the end use, end user, and country of ultimate destination of the item(s) subject to the EAR are as follows: [INSERT END USE, END USER, AND COUNTRY OF ULTIMATE DESTINATION].\n\n( iv ) Agrees to cooperate with end-use checks, including a Post-Shipment Verification, conducted by or on behalf of the Bureau of Industry and Security, U.S. Department of Commerce, for any item subject to the EAR in transactions to which they were a party in the last five years. This cooperation includes facilitating the timely conduct of the check and providing full and accurate information concerning the disposition of items subject to the EAR.\n\n( v ) Agrees to provide copies of this document and all other export, reexport or transfer (in-country) records required to be retained in part 762 of the EAR.\n\n( vi ) Certifies that the individual signing the UVL statement has sufficient authority to legally bind the party.\n\n( c ) Criteria for revising the Unverified List.\n\n( 1 ) Foreign persons who are parties to an export, reexport, and transfer (in-country) subject to the EAR may be added to the Unverified List if BIS or federal officials acting on BIS's behalf cannot verify the bona fides ( i.e. , legitimacy and reliability relating to the end use and end user of items subject to the EAR) of such persons because an end-use check, such as a pre-license check (PLC) or a post-shipment verification (PSV), cannot be completed satisfactorily for reasons outside of the U.S. Government's control. Examples in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section provide an illustrative list of those circumstances.\n\n( i ) During the conduct of an end-use check, the subject of the check is unable to demonstrate the disposition of items subject to the EAR.\n\n( ii ) The existence or authenticity of the subject of an end-use check cannot be verified (e.g., the subject of the check cannot be located or contacted).\n\n( iii ) Lack of cooperation by the host government authority prevents an end-use check from being conducted.\n\n( 2 ) BIS will remove a person from the Unverified List when BIS is able to verify the bona fides of the listed person as an end user, consignee, or other party to exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) involving items subject to the EAR by completing a PLC or PSV. In the limited circumstance involving a PLC or PSV that cannot be completed due to lack of host government cooperation, an alternative bona fides verification process may be determined by BIS to be sufficient. A determination to remove a person from the Unverified List based on the criteria in this paragraph is separate from any determination made by BIS pursuant to § 744.11(b) of the EAR, and must be requested through paragraph (d) of this section.\n\n( d ) Procedure for requesting removal of a person on the Unverified List.

In addition to the license requirements set forth elsewhere in the EAR, you may not export, reexport or transfer (in-country) microprocessors (“microprocessor microcircuits,” “microcomputer microcircuits,” and microcontroller microcircuits having a processing speed of 5 GFLOPS or more and an arithmetic logic unit with an access width of 32 bit or more, including those incorporating “information security” functionality), or associated “software” and “technology” for the “production” or “development” of such microprocessors without a license if, at the time of the export, reexport or transfer (in-country), you know, have reason to know, or are informed by BIS that the item will be or is intended to be used for a 'military end use,' as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, in a destination listed in Country Group D:1 (see supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR); or by a 'military end user,' as defined in paragraph (e) of this section, in a destination listed in Country Group D:1.\n\n( b ) Additional prohibition on exporters or reexporters informed by BIS. BIS may inform an exporter, reexporter or transferor, either individually by specific notice or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is required for export, reexport or transfer (in-country) of items described in paragraph (a) of this section to specified end users, because BIS has determined that there is an unacceptable risk of diversion to the end uses or end users described in paragraph (a) of this section. Specific notice is to be given only by, or at the direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by a written notice within two working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. The absence of any such notification does not excuse the exporter, reexporter or transferor from compliance with the license requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.\n\n( c ) License review standards. There is a presumption of denial for applications to export, reexport or transfer (in-country) items subject to this section.\n\n( d ) Military end-use. In this section, the phrase `military end use' means incorporation into: a military item described on the U.S. Munitions List (USML) ( 22 CFR part 121 , International Traffic in Arms Regulations) or the Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List (as set out on the Wassenaar Arrangement Web site at http://www.wassenaar.org ); commodities classified under ECCNs ending in “A018” or under “600 series” ECCNs; or any commodity that is designed for the “use,” “development,” “production,” or deployment of military items described on the USML, the Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List or classified under ECCNs ending in “A018” or under “600 series” ECCNs. supplement No. 1 of this part lists examples of 'military end use.'\n\n( e ) Military end user. In this section, the term 'military end user' means the national armed services (army, navy, marine, air force, or coast guard), as well as the national guard and national police, government intelligence or reconnaissance organizations, or any person or entity whose actions or functions are intended to support 'military end uses' as defined in paragraph (d) of this section.\n\n( f ) Exceptions. The prohibitions described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section supersede any license exception or No License Required (NLR) designation that would otherwise apply to a transaction subject to the EAR, except that this license requirement does not apply to exports, reexports or transfers (in-country) of items for or on behalf of the official use by personnel and agencies of the U.S. Government or to agencies of a cooperating government authorized by License Exception GOV pursuant to § 740.11 of the EAR.

In addition to the license requirements for items specified on the Commerce Control List (CCL) (supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR), you may not export, reexport, or transfer (in-country):\n\n( 1 ) Any item subject to the EAR listed in supplement no. 2 to this part without a license if, at the time of the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country), you have “knowledge,” as defined in § 772.1 of the EAR, that the item is intended, entirely or in part, for a 'military end use,' as defined in paragraph (f) of this section, in Burma, Cambodia, the People's Republic of China (China), Nicaragua, or Venezuela, or a Burmese, Cambodian, Chinese, Nicaraguan, or Venezuelan 'military end user,' as defined in paragraph (g) of this section, wherever located. 'Military end users' located outside of Burma, Cambodia, China, Nicaragua, or Venezuela are limited to entities identified on the 'Military End-User' (MEU) List under supplement no. 7 to this part.\n\n( 2 ) Any item subject to the EAR without a license if, at the time of the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country), you have “knowledge,” as defined in § 772.1 of the EAR that the item is intended, entirely or in part, for a 'military end use,' as defined in paragraph (f) of this section, in Belarus or Russia, or a Belarusian or Russian 'military end user,' as defined in paragraph (g) of this section, wherever located. Belarusian or Russian 'military end users' located outside of Belarus or Russia are limited to entities identified on the Entity List under supplement no. 4 to this part with a footnote 3 designation and a reference to this section.\n\nAn entity anywhere in the world, including in Burma, Cambodia, China, Nicaragua, or Venezuela, may be listed on the Entity List as a Belarusian or Russian 'military end user' with a footnote 3 designation. If the entity is not a Belarusian or Russian 'military end user,' but has otherwise been identified by the End User Review Committee (ERC) as a 'military end user,' that entity may be identified under the 'Military End-User' (MEU) List under supplement no. 7 to this part. As noted in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, exporters, reexporters, and transferors, even in the absence of any such notification, are not excused from compliance with the license requirements of this paragraph (a) for all entities in Burma, Cambodia, China, Nicaragua, or Venezuela to determine whether the entity is a 'military end user' for purposes of paragraph (g) of this section because supplement no. 7 is not an exhaustive listing of 'military end users' in those countries. As noted in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, exporters, reexporters, and transferors, even in the absence of any such notification, are not excused from compliance with the license requirements of this paragraph (a) for all entities in Belarus or Russia to determine whether the entity is a 'military end user' for purposes of paragraph (g) of this section because supplement no. 4 under this part is not an exhaustive listing of 'military end users' in those countries.\n\n( 3 ) MEU List and Entity List restrictions extend to foreign affiliates of listed entities owned 50 percent or more by one or more listed entities or entities subject to Entity List or MEU List restrictions based upon their ownership. The MEU List and Entity List license requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section also apply to any foreign entity that is owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more listed entities or entities subject to Entity List or MEU List restrictions based upon their ownership. The license requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section do not apply to unlisted foreign affiliates that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, solely by one or more unlisted 'military end users,' unless the unlisted foreign affiliate itself meets the definition of a 'military end user.' An entity owned 50 percent or more, directly or indirectly, by multiple entities subject to EAR license requirements pursuant to some combination of the Entity List, MEU List, or SDN List designated under programs listed in § 744.8(a)(1) , is subject to the most restrictive license requirements, license exception eligibility, and license review policy applicable to one or more of its owners under the EAR.

BIS may inform you either individually by specific notice, through amendment to the EAR published in the Federal Register, or through a separate notification published in the Federal Register, that a license is required for specific exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) of any item because there is an unacceptable risk of use in or diversion to a 'military end use' in Belarus, Burma, Cambodia, China, Nicaragua, the Russian Federation, or Venezuela, or for a Belarusian, Burmese, Cambodian, Chinese, Nicaraguan, Russian, or Venezuelan 'military end user,' wherever located.

When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by written notice within two working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration or the Deputy Assistant Secretary's designee.

Exporters, reexporters, and transferors are responsible for determining whether transactions with entities not listed on supplement no. 7 or 4 to this part are subject to a license requirement under paragraph (a) of this section. The process in this paragraph (b)(1) for placing entities on the MEU List and Entity List is only one method BIS may use to inform exporters, reexporters, and transferors of license requirements under this section.",

The listing of entities under supplement no. 7 or 4 to this part is not an exhaustive listing of 'military end users' for purposes of this section, except for 'military end users' of a country identified in this section (Belarus, Burma, Cambodia, China, Nicaragua, the Russian Federation, or Venezuela) not located in that same country. As specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, 'military end users' of a country identified in this section not located in that same country are exhaustively listed on either the Entity List with a footnote 3 designation and a reference to this section, or on the MEU List under supplement no. 7 this part. Exporters, reexporters, and transferors are responsible for determining whether transactions with entities not listed on supplement no. 7 or 4 to this part are subject to a license requirement under paragraph (a) of this section. The process in this paragraph (b)(1) for placing entities on the MEU List and Entity List is only one method BIS may use to inform exporters, reexporters, and transferors of license requirements under this section.\n\n( i ) End-User Review Committee (ERC). The End-User Review Committee (ERC), composed of representatives of the Departments of Commerce (Chair), State, Defense, Energy and, where appropriate, the Treasury, makes all decisions regarding additions to, removals from, or other modifications to the MEU List and Entity List. Decisions by the ERC for purposes of the MEU List and Entity List will be made following the procedures identified in this section and in supplement no. 5 to this part (Procedures for End-User Review Committee Entity List and 'Military End User' (MEU) List Decisions).\n\n( ii ) License requirement for parties to the transaction. Consistent with paragraph (a) of this section, a license is required for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of any item subject to the EAR listed in supplement no. 2 to this part when an entity that is listed on the MEU List as a Burmese, Cambodian, Chinese, Nicaraguan, or Venezuelan 'military end user' is a party to the transaction as described in § 748.5(c) through (f) of the EAR. Consistent with paragraph (a) of this section, a license is required for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of any item subject to the EAR when a Belarusian or Russian 'military end user' that is listed on the Entity List pursuant to this section is a party to the transaction as described in § 748.5(c) through (f) of the EAR.",

However, the absence of any such notification does not excuse the “U.S. person” from compliance with the license requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.\n\n( 2 ) Consistent with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, BIS is hereby informing “U.S. persons” that a license is required for the following activities, which could involve 'support' for the weapons of mass destruction-related end uses set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Specifically, if you know your export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) meets any of the specified activities described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section, then a license is required for shipping, transmitting, or transferring (in-country); facilitating the shipment, transmission, or transfer (in-country); or servicing (including installation) activities associated with any item, end use, or end user described in any of the following paragraphs:\n\n( i ) “Development” or “production” of “advanced-node ICs.” To or within Macau or a destination specified in Country Group D:5, any item not subject to the EAR that you know will be used in the “development” or “production” of integrated circuits at a “facility” of an entity headquartered in, or whose ultimate parent company is headquartered in, either Macau or a destination specified in Country Group D:5 where “production” of “advanced-node integrated circuits” occurs;",

See Program Tag Definitions for OFAC Sanctions Lists for additional information: https://ofac.treasury.gov/specially-designated-nationals-list-sdn-list/program-tag-definitions-for-ofac-sanctions-lists .\n\n( 2 ) These EAR controls supplement and strengthen the sanctions that are imposed by OFAC on these SDNs to better ensure that U.S. national security and foreign policy interests are protected. These EAR controls also apply to any foreign affiliate of a listed entity that is owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more persons blocked pursuant to the programs listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. An entity owned 50 percent or more, directly or indirectly, by multiple entities subject to EAR license requirements pursuant to some combination of the Entity List, MEU List, or SDN List designated under programs listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, is subject to the most restrictive license requirements, license exception eligibility, and license review policy applicable to one or more of its owners under the EAR. Specifically, this section imposes controls on exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) of items subject to the EAR where the OFAC regulations are not applicable, such as in certain situations involving deemed exports and deemed reexports, and reexports and transfers (in-country) not involving the U.S. financial system or otherwise involving U.S. persons. To avoid imposing a duplicative license requirement, the transactions specified in this section do not require separate EAR authorization if the transactions are authorized under an OFAC specific or general license or are exempted under OFAC's regulations.\n\nThe Entity List in supplement no. 4 to part 744 includes certain persons that have also been designated with certain identifiers on the SDN List. See § 744.11 and supplement no. 4 to part 744 for requirements, including license review policies, for these entities, which take precedence over the requirements in this § 744.8 . BIS requires an EAR authorization as specified in the license requirement column on the Entity List for export, reexport, and transfer (in-country) transactions involving items subject to the EAR in which these persons are parties to the transaction regardless of whether such transaction is authorized under an OFAC specific or general license or exempted under OFAC's regulations.\n\n( b ) License requirements. Unless the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) is authorized under an OFAC specific or general license or exempted under OFAC's regulations, a license is required under the EAR for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of any item “subject to the EAR” when a person who is designated on OFAC's SDN List with, or blocked pursuant to, any of the identifiers set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is a party to the transaction as described in § 748.5(c) through (f) . A Department of Commerce license is not required for transactions described in this paragraph (b) that would have otherwise met all of the terms and conditions of an OFAC general license if the transactions had been subject to OFAC jurisdiction.\n\n( c ) License exceptions. No license exceptions may overcome the license requirements in this section, except for entities that are also listed on the Entity List in supplement no. 4 to part 744 that have certain license exception eligibility, which is available to overcome the license requirements of this section and supplement no. 4 to part 744 for that specific entity.\n\n( d ) License review policy. Applications for licenses required by this section will be subject to a presumption of denial license review policy, except when note 1 to paragraph (a)(1) of this section is applicable and the license review policy specified on the Entity List in supplement no. 4 to part 744 is different, in which case the license review policy under the applicable Entity List entry for that person would govern. You should consult OFAC regarding transactions subject to licensing requirements under regulations maintained by OFAC.\n\n( e ) Violations.\n\n( 1 ) Any export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) by a U.S. person of any item subject to both the EAR and regulations maintained by OFAC in situations in which a person identified in paragraph (a)(1) is a party to the transaction as described in § 748.5(c) through (f) that is not authorized by OFAC constitutes a violation of the EAR. This paragraph does not apply to entities identified under both this section and the Entity List in supplement no. 4 to part 744. EAR violations involving entities identified under both this section and the Entity List will be addressed pursuant to §§ 744.11 and 744.16 .",

This part implements broad based controls for items and activities subject to the EAR imposed to implement U.S. government policies. Two categories of controls are included in this part.\n\n( a ) Comprehensive controls. This part contains or refers to all the BIS licensing requirements, licensing policies, and License Exceptions for countries subject to general embargoes or comprehensive sanctions, currently Cuba, Iran, and Syria. This part is the focal point for all the EAR requirements for transactions involving these countries.\n\n( 1 ) Cuba. All the items on the Commerce Control List (CCL) require a license to Cuba. In addition, most other items subject to the EAR, but not included on the CCL, designated by the Number “EAR99”, require a license to Cuba. Most items requiring a license to these destinations are subject to a general policy of denial. Because these controls extend to virtually all exports, they do not appear in the Country Chart in part 738 of the EAR, nor are they reflected in the Commerce Control List in part 774 of the EAR.\n\n( 2 ) Iran. BIS maintains license requirements and other restrictions on exports and reexports to Iran. A comprehensive embargo on transactions involving this country is administered by the Department of The Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).\n\n( 3 ) Syria. Section 746.9 of this part sets forth the specific license requirements, licensing policy and license exceptions applicable to Syria.\n\n( b ) Sanctions on selected categories of items to specific destinations.\n\n( 1 ) BIS controls the export and reexport of selected categories of items to countries under United Nations Security Council arms embargoes. See the Commerce Control List in supplement no. 1 to part 774. See also §§ 746.3 (Iraq) and 746.4 (North Korea).\n\n( 2 ) The countries subject to United Nations Security Council arms embargoes are: Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, and Sudan.\n\n( 3 ) A license is required to export or reexport items identified in Part 774 as having a “UN” reason for control to countries identified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. To the extent consistent with United States national security and foreign policy interests, BIS will not approve applications for such licenses if the authorization would be contrary to the relevant United Nations Security Council Resolution.\n\n( 4 ) You may not use any License Exception, other than License Exception GOV, for items for personal or official use by personnel and agencies of the U.S. Government or agencies of cooperating governments as set forth in § 740.11(b) of the EAR, to export or reexport items with a UN reason for control to countries listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. This paragraph does not apply to Iraq, which is governed by § 746.3(c) of this part ; North Korea, which is governed by § 746.4(c) of this part ; or Iran, which is governed by § 746.7(c) of this part .\n\n( c ) Russian Industry Sector Sanctions. The Russian Industry Sector Sanctions are set forth under § 746.5 and referenced under the License Requirements section of certain Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs) in supplement No. 1 to part 774 (Commerce Control List), as well as in a footnote to the Commerce Country Chart in supplement no. 1 to part 738.\n\n( d ) This part also contains descriptions of controls maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control in the Treasury Department and by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls in the Department of State. Comprehensive embargoes and supplemental controls implemented by BIS under the EAR usually also involve controls on items and activities maintained by these agencies. This part sets forth the allocation of licensing responsibilities between BIS and these other agencies.

UNSC Resolutions 707 and 687 require that Iraq eliminate its nuclear weapons program and restrict its nuclear activities to the use of isotopes for medical, industrial or agricultural purposes. Such resolutions further mandate that Iraq eliminate its chemical and biological weapons programs as well as its ballistic missile program. In support of the applicable UNSC resolutions, certain Iraq specific license requirements and licensing policies are detailed in this section. In addition, this section details restrictions on transfers of items subject to the EAR within Iraq. Exporters should be aware that other provisions of the EAR, including parts 742 and 744, will continue to apply with respect to exports and reexports to Iraq and transfers within Iraq.\n\n( a ) License requirements.\n\n( 1 ) A license is required for the export or reexport to Iraq or transfer within Iraq of any item controlled on the Commerce Control List for NS, MT, NP, CW, CB, RS, CC, EI, SI, or SL reasons. See part 742 of the EAR.\n\n( 2 ) A license is required for the export or reexport to Iraq or transfer within Iraq of any item controlled on the Commerce Control List for UN reasons.\n\n( 3 ) A license is required for the export or reexport to Iraq or transfer within Iraq of items on the Commerce Control List controlled for RS reasons under the following ECCNs: 0B999, 0D999, 1B999, 1C992, 1C995, 1C997, 1C999 and 6A992.\n\n( 4 ) A license is required for the export or reexport to Iraq or transfer within Iraq of any item subject to the EAR if, at the time of the export, reexport or transfer, you know, have reason to know, or are informed by BIS that the item will be, or is intended to be, used for a “military end-use” or by a “military end-user”, as defined in this section. This license requirement does not apply to exports, reexports or transfers of items for the official use by personnel and agencies of the U.S. Government or exports, reexports or transfers to the Government of Iraq. See § 740.11(b)(3) of the EAR for the definition of “agency of the U.S. Government.” BIS may inform an exporter, reexporter, or other person, either individually by specific notice or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is required for export, reexport or transfer of items subject to the EAR to specified end-users, because BIS has determined that there is an unacceptable risk of diversion to the uses or users described in this paragraph. Specific notice is to be given only by, or at the direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by a written notice within two working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. The absence of any such notification does not excuse the exporter, reexporter or other person from compliance with the license requirements of this paragraph.\n\n( i ) Military end-use. In this section, the phrase “military end-use” means incorporation into a military item described on the U.S. Munitions List (USML) ( 22 CFR part 121 , International Traffic in Arms Regulations) or the Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List (WAML) (as set out on the Wassenaar Arrangement website at http://www.wassenaar.org ); or use, development, or deployment of military items described on the USML or the WAML.\n\n( ii ) Military end-user. In this section, the term “military end-user” means any “person” whose actions or functions are intended to support “military end-uses” as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section and who is not recognized as a legitimate military organization by the U.S. Government.\n\n( 5 ) Definitions. For purposes of exports or reexports to Iraq or transfers within Iraq, “ballistic missile” is defined as any missile capable of a range greater than 150 kilometers.\n\n( b ) Licensing policy.\n\n( 1 ) License applications for the export or reexport to Iraq or transfer within Iraq of items listed in paragraph (a)(1) , (a)(2) , or (a)(3) of this section for Iraqi civil nuclear or military nuclear activity, except for use of isotopes for medical, industrial or agricultural purposes, will be subject to a policy of denial.\n\n( 2 ) License applications for the export or reexport to Iraq or transfer within Iraq of machine tools controlled for national security (NS) or nuclear nonproliferation (NP) reasons, as well as for any items controlled for crime control (CC) or United Nations (UN) reasons (including items classified under ECCN 0A505.c) or ECCNs that end in the number “018” or items classified under “600 series” ECCNs, that would make a material contribution to the production, research, design, development, support, maintenance or manufacture of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, ballistic missiles or arms and related materiel will be subject to a general policy of denial. Exports of “600 series” items to the Government of Iraq will be reviewed under the policies set forth for such items in §§ 742.4(b) and 742.6(b) of the EAR.\n\n( 3 ) License applications for the export or reexport to Iraq or transfer within Iraq of items listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine if they would contribute to the building of Iraqi civil infrastructure. Applications determined not to contribute to the building of Iraqi civil infrastructure will be subject to a general policy of denial.\n\n( 4 ) License applications for the export or reexport to Iraq or transfer within Iraq of items listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section will be subject to a policy of denial.",

The countries listed in supplement No. 3 to this part have committed to implementing substantially similar export controls on Russia and Belarus under their domestic laws. Therefore, exports or reexports from the countries listed in supplement No. 3 to this part or transfers (in-country) within the countries listed in this supplement are not subject to the license requirements described in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) of this section, unless a limit to the exclusion is described in the Scope column in supplement no. 3 to this part.\n\n( 5 ) Exclusion for deployments by the Government of Ukraine to or within the temporarily occupied Crimea region of Ukraine or covered regions of Ukraine. The license requirements of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to exports, reexports, and transfers (in country) used in or for deployments by the Government of Ukraine to or within the temporarily occupied Crimea region of Ukraine or covered regions of Ukraine.\n\n( b ) License review policy. With limited exceptions, applications for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of any item that requires a license pursuant to the requirements of this section will be reviewed with a policy of denial. The following types of license applications for licenses required under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis: applications related to safety of flight; applications related to maritime safety; applications for civil nuclear safety; applications to meet humanitarian needs; applications that support government space cooperation; applications for items destined to wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries, foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies that are joint ventures with other U.S. companies, joint ventures of U.S. companies with companies headquartered in countries from Country Group A:5 and A:6 in supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR, the wholly-owned subsidiaries of companies headquartered in countries from Country Group A:5 and A:6 in supplement no. 1 to part 740, joint ventures of companies headquartered in Country Groups A:5 and A:6 with other companies headquartered in Country Groups A:5 and A:6; applications for companies headquartered in the United States or in Country Groups A:5 and A:6 to support civil telecommunications infrastructure; and government-to-government activities. In reviewing such applications, whether the transaction in question would benefit the Russian or Belarusian government or defense sector or would otherwise be detrimental to the country or people of Ukraine are factors that will be taken into consideration.\n\n( c ) License exceptions. You may export, reexport or transfer (in-country) without a license if your transaction meets all the applicable terms and conditions of any of the license exception paragraphs specified in this paragraph (c) . To determine scope and eligibility requirements, you will need to refer to the sections or specific paragraphs of part 740 (License Exceptions) of the EAR, as well as § 740.2 license exception restrictions. Read each license exception carefully, as the provisions available for countries subject to sanctions are generally narrow.\n\n( 1 ) TMP for items for use by the news media as set forth in § 740.9(a)(9) of the EAR.\n\n( 2 ) GOV for items for personal or official use by personnel and agencies of the U.S. Government, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), or the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) as set forth in § 740.11(a) and (b)(2) of the EAR.\n\n( 3 ) GFT for gift parcels and humanitarian donations as set forth in § 740.12 of the EAR.\n\n( 4 ) TSU for operation technology and software for lawfully exported commodities as set forth in § 740.13(a) and sales technology as set forth in § 740.13 (b) of the EAR.\n\n( 5 ) BAG for exports of items by individuals leaving the United States as personal baggage as set forth in § 740.14(a) through (d) of the EAR.\n\n( 6 ) AVS for civil aircraft and vessels as set forth in § 740.15(a)(4) and (d) of the EAR.\n\n( 7 ) License Exception MED (§ 740.23 of the EAR).\n\n( d ) Definitions.

This embargo includes prohibitions on exports and certain reexport transactions involving Iran, including transactions dealing with items subject to the EAR. These prohibitions are set forth in OFAC's Iranian Transactions Regulations ( 31 CFR part 560 ). In addition, BIS maintains licensing requirements on exports and reexports to or from Iran under the EAR as described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section or elsewhere in the EAR ( see, e.g., § 742.8 ).\n\n( a ) License requirements —\n\n( 1 ) EAR license requirements —\n\n( i ) CCL-based license requirements. A license is required under the EAR to export or reexport to Iran any item on the CCL containing a CB Column 1, CB Column 2, CB Column 3, NP Column 1, NP Column 2, NS Column 1, NS Column 2, MT Column 1, RS Column 1, RS Column 2, CC Column 1, CC Column 2, CC Column 3, AT Column 1 or AT Column 2 in the Country Chart Column of the License Requirements section of an ECCN or classified under ECCNs 0A503, 0A980, 0A982, 0A983, 0E982, 1C355, 1C395, 1C980, 1C982, 1C983, 1C984, 2A994, 2D994, 2E994, 5A001.f.1, 5A980, 5D001 (for 5A001.f.1or for 5E001.a (for 5A001.f.1, or for 5D001.a (for 5A001.f.1)), 5D980, 5E001.a (for 5A001.f.1, or for 5D001.a (for 5A001.f.1)) or 5E980.\n\n( ii ) Supplement no. 7 to part 746 of the EAR license requirements. A license is required under the EAR to export or reexport to Iran any item identified in supplement no. 7 to part 746 of the EAR when such item is subject to the EAR for any reason other than § 734.9(j) of the EAR.\n\n( iii ) Foreign-produced items subject to the EAR under § 734.9(j) of the EAR (Iran FDP rule). Except as described in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section, a license is required to reexport or export from abroad to, or transfer (in-country) within Iran any foreign-produced item subject to the EAR under the Iran FDP rule that is located in or destined to Iran. A Department of Commerce license is not required for transactions described in this paragraph (a)(1)(iii) that would have otherwise met all of the terms and conditions of an OFAC general license or other authorization if the transactions had been subject to OFAC jurisdiction.\n\n( iv ) Exclusion from license requirements under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.\n\n( A ) Exports from abroad or reexports from the countries described in supplement no. 3 to this part are not subject to the license requirements described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, unless a limit to the exclusion is described in the “Scope” column in supplement no. 3 to this part.\n\n( B ) An item is excluded from license requirements under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section if the item is any of the following:\n\n( 1 ) Food, “medicine,” or “medical devices” designated as EAR99;\n\n( 2 ) Necessary and ordinarily incident to communications, designated as EAR99 or specified in ECCN 5A992.c or 5D992.c, and classified in accordance with § 740.17 of the EAR; and would otherwise meet all of the terms and conditions of an OFAC general license or other authorization if the transaction were subject to OFAC jurisdiction.\n\n( v ) Exclusion from scope of U.S.-origin controlled content under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. For purposes of determining U.S.-origin controlled content under supplement no. 2 to part 734 of the EAR when making a de minimis calculation for reexports and exports from a country described in supplement no. 3 to this part to Iran, the license requirements in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section are not used to determine controlled U.S.-origin content in a foreign-made item, provided the U.S.-origin content is identified in supplement no. 7 to this part and is designated EAR99 and is not otherwise excluded from the applicable “Scope” column in supplement no. 3 to this part.\n\n( 2 ) BIS authorization. To avoid duplication, exporters or reexporters are not required to seek separate authorization from BIS for an export or reexport subject both to the EAR and to OFAC's Iranian Transactions Regulations. Therefore, if OFAC authorizes an export or reexport, such authorization is considered authorization for purposes of the EAR as well. Transactions that are not subject to OFAC regulatory authority may require BIS authorization.\n\n( b ) Licensing policy. Applications for licenses for transactions for humanitarian reasons or for the safety of civil aviation and safe operation of U.S-origin aircraft will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
