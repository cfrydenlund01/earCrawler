# Agent Docs Index

Read order:
1) `AGENTS.md`
2) This file (`.agents/00-index.md`)

Then open only the smallest relevant doc(s):
- Repo layout and "where is X?": `.agents/10-repo-overview.md`
- How to run the CLI/CI/release/monitoring: `.agents/20-pipeline.md`
- Research/experimentation workflow: `.agents/70-research.md`
- How to make safe changes: `.agents/30-conventions.md`
- Lint/format/test commands: `.agents/40-testing-and-quality.md`
- Environment variables, keys, and secrets handling: `.agents/50-env-and-secrets.md`
- Cleanup rules (deletion plans, archives, generated artifacts): `.agents/60-cleanup-policy.md`

## Working Set (recommended)
Maintain a short list of files you opened or are actively reasoning about.

Template:
- `path/to/file` — why it’s in context
