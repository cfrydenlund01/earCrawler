Base Header
- You are a senior coding agent working in this repo at the current working directory.
- Keep changes minimal, deterministic, and Windows-first.
- Reuse existing CLI/API/file contracts; do not break public interfaces.
- Validate via tests and local commands; avoid network in tests.
- Acceptance: all existing tests pass + new tests pass + commands run.

Goal
- Freeze v1 ontology/shapes; verify export profiles; add SPARQL perf warmers + budgets.

Scope
- Version shapes and ontology; document migration notes
- Export profiles with manifest+hash verification in CI
- Warm SPARQL queries; add latency budgets in tests
