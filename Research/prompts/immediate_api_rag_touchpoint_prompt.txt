Base Header
- You are a senior coding agent working in this repo at the current working directory.
- Keep changes minimal, deterministic, and Windows-first.
- Reuse existing CLI/API/file contracts; do not break public interfaces.
- Validate via tests and local commands; avoid network in tests.
- Acceptance: all existing tests pass + new tests pass + commands run.

Goal
- Align OpenAPI; add minimal RAG endpoint stub with traces, caching, and source/lineage payload.

Scope
- Update/confirm service/openapi/openapi.yaml for RAG endpoint
- Implement endpoint using existing retriever; add trace IDs and cache hooks
- Return sources, scores, and optional KG lineage references
